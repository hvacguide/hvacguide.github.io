<p>Enhance your services, make more services revenue, and provide an incredible client experience. To make certain the system you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to figure out the specific type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
