<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
