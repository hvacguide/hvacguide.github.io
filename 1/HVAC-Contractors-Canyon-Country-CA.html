<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly.
