Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
