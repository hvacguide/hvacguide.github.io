In addition, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra materials and equipment.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
