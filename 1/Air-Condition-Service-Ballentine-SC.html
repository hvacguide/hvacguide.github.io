<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
