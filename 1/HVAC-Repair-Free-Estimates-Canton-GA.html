<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building residents may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are typically mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, tiredness and queasiness. The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
