<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A third method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your home may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
