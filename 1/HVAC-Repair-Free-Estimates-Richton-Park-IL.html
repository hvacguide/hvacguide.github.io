<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
