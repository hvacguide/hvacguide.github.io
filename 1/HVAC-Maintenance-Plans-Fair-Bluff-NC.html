<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
