<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now.

He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
