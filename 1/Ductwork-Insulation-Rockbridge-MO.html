<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile houses, apartments, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, etc.).

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
