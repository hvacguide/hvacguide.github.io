<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>

In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated issues-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three strategies listed below might be proper.<p>
