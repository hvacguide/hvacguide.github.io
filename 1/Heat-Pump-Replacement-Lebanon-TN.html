<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
