<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
