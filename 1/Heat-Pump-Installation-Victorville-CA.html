<p>Info supplied in this safety guide is based upon current scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your home's systems.

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

Nevertheless, a geothermal installation usually costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally suggests it fails in terms of roi.<p>
