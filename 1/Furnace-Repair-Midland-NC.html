<h3>Heating System Installation in Midland NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Work environment temperatures should be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%.
