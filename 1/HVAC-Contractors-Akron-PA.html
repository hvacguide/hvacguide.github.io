<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
