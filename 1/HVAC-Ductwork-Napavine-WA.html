<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
