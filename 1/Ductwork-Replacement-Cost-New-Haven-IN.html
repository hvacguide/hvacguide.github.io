<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
