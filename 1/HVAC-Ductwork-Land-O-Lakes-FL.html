<p>Chemical pollutants: Unstable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, flooring and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
