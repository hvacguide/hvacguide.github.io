My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
