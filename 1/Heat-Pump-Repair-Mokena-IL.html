<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
