<p>If your furnace has actually simply passed away in sub-zero temperatures or your air conditioner has gone kaput on a sweltering day, you'll probably be pleased to hire the very first repairman who comes to your house that day. However, if you're planning a major or expensive  upgrade to your home's heating, air conditioning or air ducts, it's worth the time to research study and interview numerous companies before employing one.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad.
