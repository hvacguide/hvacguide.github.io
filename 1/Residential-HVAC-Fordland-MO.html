<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy costs. Load determining is described as the Manual J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone.
