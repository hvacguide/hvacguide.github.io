After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
