<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
