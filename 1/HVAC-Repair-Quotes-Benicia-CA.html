<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
