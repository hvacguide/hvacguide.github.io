<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation. Workplace temperatures should be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air circulation ought to be avoided.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
