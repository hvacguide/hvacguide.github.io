<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other kinds of heatpump, have performances rated according to their coefficient of performance, or COP. It's a clinical way of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every single system of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to five systems are provided as heat.<p>
