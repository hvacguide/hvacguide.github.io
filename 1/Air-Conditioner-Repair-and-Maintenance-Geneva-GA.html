<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
