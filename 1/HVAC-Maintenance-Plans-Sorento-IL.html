Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
