<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
