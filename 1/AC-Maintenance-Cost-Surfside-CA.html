<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
