<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem.

Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
