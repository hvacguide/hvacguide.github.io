<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
