<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
