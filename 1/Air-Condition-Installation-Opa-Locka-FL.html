<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
