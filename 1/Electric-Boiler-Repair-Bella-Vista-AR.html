<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
