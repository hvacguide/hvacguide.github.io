The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to.

Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.

Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
