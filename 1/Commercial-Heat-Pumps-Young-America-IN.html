<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units.

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
