Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Brands brought: When looking for estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling equipment make sure to ask prospective companies what specific manufacturers or equipment brand names they carry.
