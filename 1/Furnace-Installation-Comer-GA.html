Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried.
