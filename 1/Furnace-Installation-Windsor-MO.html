<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>I have used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance contract which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has been fantastic through all these years. Constantly keeps my system tuned and serviced. Have not had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he notifies me about it and proactively fixes the parts. Really delighted with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
