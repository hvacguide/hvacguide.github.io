<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Lobeco SC</h3>
<p>10% - 20% AC Repair Houston Heights HVAC Utility Cost Savings. When they are away from their Houston Heights house, most people benefit by using programmable thermostats. You can save on your programmable thermostat while you are resting, & give your cooling system breaks at least 2-3 hours every night while you are sleeping.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
