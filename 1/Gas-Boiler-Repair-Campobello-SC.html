<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues.
