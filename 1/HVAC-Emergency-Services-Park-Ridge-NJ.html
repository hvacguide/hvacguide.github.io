<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
