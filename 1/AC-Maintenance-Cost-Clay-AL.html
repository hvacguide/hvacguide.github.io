<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company in Clay AL</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really experienced. Costs are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was undoubtedly reasonable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
