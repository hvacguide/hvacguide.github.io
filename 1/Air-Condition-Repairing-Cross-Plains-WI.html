<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save money on costs (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops vary outside of an acceptable range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the entire workplace or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
