<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
