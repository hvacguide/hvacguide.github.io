<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, straightforward and a completely pleasurable individual to have around that whole time. His time and competence to RESOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>There are many things to consider when trying to find out how typically I must change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has an unique DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better best decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter need replacing more often.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
