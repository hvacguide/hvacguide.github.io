<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives usually amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (homes usually use in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
