<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Blackwood NJ Home Owners</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require reasonably little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be inspected at least twice per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
