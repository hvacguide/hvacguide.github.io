Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

This ought to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>

Micro-organisms or bacteria might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
