<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
