An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
