<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Clarksville MD?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
