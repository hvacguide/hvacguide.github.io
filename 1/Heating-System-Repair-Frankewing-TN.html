<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
