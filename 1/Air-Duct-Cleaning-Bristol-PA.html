<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
