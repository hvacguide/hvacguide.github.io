<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Avilla IN</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
