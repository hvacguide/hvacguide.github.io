This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
