<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Shirley MA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
