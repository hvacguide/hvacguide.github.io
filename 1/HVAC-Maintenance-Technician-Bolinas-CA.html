<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Bolinas CA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of a/c unit, several primary aspects require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any barriers en route of the airflow that may avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outside system must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely advisable to install the air conditioning unit systems in quickly accessible places, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are accountable for lots of hazardous results, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are essential to produce particular health issue. People likewise react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research is needed to better comprehend which health effects take place after exposure to the average toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the greater concentrations that happen for short amount of times.<p>
<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
