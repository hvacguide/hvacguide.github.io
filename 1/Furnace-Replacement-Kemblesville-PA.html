And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the conventional water heater.

<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however lead to higher energy bills.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.)
