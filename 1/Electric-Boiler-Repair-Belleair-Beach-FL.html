<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used.
