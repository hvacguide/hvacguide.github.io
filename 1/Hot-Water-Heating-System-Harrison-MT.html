<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the United States, the EPA has actually enforced tighter restrictions for many years. There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
