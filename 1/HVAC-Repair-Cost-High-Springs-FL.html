<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key part of your a/c is the outside unit.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
