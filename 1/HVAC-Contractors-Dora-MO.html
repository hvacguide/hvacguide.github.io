<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
