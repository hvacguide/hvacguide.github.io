<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
