<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.
