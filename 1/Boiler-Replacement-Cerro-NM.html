<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Cerro NM</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
