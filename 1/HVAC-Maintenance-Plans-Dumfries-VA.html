<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
