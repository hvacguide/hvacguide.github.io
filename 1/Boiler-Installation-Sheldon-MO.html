<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Want to Understand in Sheldon MO</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
