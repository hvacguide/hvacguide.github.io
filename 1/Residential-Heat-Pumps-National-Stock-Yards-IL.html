<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
