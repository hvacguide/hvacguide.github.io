<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
