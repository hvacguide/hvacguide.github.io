The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
