<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in West End</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in West End North Carolina</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
