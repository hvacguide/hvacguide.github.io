<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest.

Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
