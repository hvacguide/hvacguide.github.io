This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
