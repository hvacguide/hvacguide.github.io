<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
