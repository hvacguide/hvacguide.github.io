<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just including refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A qualified technician needs to repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than room air conditioners. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and hassle-free to operate. To save energy and money, you must try to buy an energy-efficient air conditioner and minimize your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use. In a typical air-conditioned house, cooling consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, triggering power plants to give off about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
