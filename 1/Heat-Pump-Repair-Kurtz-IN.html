<p>There are many things to take into consideration when trying to find out how frequently I ought to change my cooling filters.

It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better best decision on how often your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one cooling filter need changing more frequently.<p>
