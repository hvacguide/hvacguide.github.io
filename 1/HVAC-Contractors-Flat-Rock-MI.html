This is usually used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
