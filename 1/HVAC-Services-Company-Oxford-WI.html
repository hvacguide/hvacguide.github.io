<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Oxford WI</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, houses, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
