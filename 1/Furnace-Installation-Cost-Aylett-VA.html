Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
