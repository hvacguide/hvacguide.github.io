<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
