Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
