(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips.
