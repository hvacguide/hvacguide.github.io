<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
