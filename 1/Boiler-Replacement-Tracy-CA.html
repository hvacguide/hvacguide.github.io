<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
