Central air conditioning conditioners should be professionally inspected and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual checkup. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
