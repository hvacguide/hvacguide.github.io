<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate considerable cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

Occupational exposure limitations listed in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent illness or particular impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial scenarios. These limits may not be suitable in office settings or for the house.<p>
