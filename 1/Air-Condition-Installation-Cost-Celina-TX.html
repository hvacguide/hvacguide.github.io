Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a few years back.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
