<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.
