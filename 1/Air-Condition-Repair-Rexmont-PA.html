<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve.
