<p>A geothermal heater does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, coal, or oil. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses considerably less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable influence on the environment.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
