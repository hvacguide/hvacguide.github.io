<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a method that develops dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a risk only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for considerable health issue.<p>
