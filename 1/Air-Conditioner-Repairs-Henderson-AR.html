<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
