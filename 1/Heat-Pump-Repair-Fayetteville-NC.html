<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
