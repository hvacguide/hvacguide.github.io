<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
