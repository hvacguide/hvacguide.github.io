I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
