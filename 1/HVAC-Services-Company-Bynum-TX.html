<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
