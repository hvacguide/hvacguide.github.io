<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
