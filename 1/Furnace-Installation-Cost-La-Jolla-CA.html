<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
