<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
