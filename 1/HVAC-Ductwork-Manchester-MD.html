<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical power, a heat pump is a cost-effective option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
