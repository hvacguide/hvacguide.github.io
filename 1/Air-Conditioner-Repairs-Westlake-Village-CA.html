<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
