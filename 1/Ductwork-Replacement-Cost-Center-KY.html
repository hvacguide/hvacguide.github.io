<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
