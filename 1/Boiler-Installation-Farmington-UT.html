Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Farmington UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
