<p>For instance, issues emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, however care should be required to make sure comfort. In warm or humid environments, maintaining thermal convenience exclusively through natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements.
