Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
