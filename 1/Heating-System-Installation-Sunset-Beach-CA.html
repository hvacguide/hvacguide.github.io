Some buildings can likewise utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air presented into a space per an unit of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, heating and air-conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
