<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
