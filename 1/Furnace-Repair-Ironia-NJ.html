<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating unit.

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
