<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales man comes to your home he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the options for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Garner NC?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by just utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a qualified representative from a company or seller to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided guarantee will not do you any good should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and work with a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
