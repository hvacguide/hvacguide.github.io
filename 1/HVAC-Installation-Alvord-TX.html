<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be infected (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these toxins throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread contaminants from one portion of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these issues.<p>
