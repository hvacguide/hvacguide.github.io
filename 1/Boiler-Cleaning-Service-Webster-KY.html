Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
