<p>There is no easy answer, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a better solution. If the present system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
