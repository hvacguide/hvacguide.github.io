<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
