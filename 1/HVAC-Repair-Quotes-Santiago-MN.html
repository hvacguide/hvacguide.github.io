<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly).
