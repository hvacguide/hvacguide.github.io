Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems.

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
