<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
