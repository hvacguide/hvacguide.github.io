<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>As discussed above, triggering your new under tile floor heater prematurely, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere correctly, and might void the guarantee of your mortar item. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had treated. If you do not follow their instructions, and mortar manufacturers might refuse warranty protection.<p>
