PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
