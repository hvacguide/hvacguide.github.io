<p>All homes require effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other offices is necessary not only for workers' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific diseases have actually been linked to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate signs but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the greatest performance equipment readily available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air leaves the system.<p>
