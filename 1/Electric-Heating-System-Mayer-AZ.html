<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and offered source of energy.<p>
