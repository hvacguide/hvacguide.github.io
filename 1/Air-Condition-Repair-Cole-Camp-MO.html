<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead.

At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma may discover being indoors uses the best relief, if the indoor air environment is excellent.

An unexpected shift in temperature level from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, nowadays. While many individuals assume pollution is just an outside issue, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not think sufficient about exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
