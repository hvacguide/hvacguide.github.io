<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
