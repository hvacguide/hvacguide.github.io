<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
