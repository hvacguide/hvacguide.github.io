<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
