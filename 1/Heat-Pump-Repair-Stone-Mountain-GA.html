Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
