The requirements do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services ought to still be available for your home's systems.

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, volatile organic substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause adverse health conditions. Source control, filtering and making use of ventilation to water down impurities are the main methods for improving indoor air quality in most structures. Residential systems can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can collect and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up till several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from job sites.<p>
