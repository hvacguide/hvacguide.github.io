<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief cycling in very winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. Sometimes, the furnace will merely run more difficult to preserve a warm climate for your house when the weather is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our technicians if you require clearness on this problem.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system.

The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
