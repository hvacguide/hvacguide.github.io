<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool needs to recognize the number of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; show when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or illnesses; recognize all machines operated in the office; suggest the kind of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>These men have been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these men two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
