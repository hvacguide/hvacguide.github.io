<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
