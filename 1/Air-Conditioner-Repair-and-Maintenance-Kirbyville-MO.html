<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may end up being blocked, reducing air flow volume, quality, and circulation. They likewise might end up being locations for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be properly maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
