<p>Improve your services, earn more services profits, and provide a fantastic consumer experience. To make sure the unit you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the precise type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in New Lenox Illinois</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
