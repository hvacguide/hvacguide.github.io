<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They met my needs totally by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
