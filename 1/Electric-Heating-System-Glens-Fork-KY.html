Such a tool needs to determine the variety of people affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; identify where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of specific health signs or diseases; determine all machines run in the office; show the kind of outside air pollution; and determine possible sources of job stress.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators.
