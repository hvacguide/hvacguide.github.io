<h3>Picking the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Hillsdale KS</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
