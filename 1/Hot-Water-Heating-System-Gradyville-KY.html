The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Because an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
