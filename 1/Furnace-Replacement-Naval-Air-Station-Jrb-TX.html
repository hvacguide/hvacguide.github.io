<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
