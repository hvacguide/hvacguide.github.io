<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Already planning to change an existing a/c? Assuming your spending plan accommodates a variable speed unit, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be lot cleaner. At least, consider a two phase compressor for enhanced comfort and effectiveness.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
