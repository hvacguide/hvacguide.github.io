It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>
