<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based on the average temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and structure occupants may be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning items, construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
