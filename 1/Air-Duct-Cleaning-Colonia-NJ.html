<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
