Not all heating systems are good for all houses, and there are a couple of aspects that absolutely need to be thought about prior to selecting one. Initially, you'll require one that is effectively sized for your home.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
