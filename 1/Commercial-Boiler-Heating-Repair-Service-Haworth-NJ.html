They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My better half stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually met in a very long time.
