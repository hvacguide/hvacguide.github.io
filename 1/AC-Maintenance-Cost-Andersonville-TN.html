<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company.
