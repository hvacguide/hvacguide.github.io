<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
