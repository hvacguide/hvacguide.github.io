<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person should be called for practically any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioners must be professionally checked and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
