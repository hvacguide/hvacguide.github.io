<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Minnetonka</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, merely adding refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician must repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
