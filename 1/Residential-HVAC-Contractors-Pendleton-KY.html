Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits.

The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
