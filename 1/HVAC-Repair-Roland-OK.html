<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
