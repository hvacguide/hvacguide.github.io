There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it repaired and checked. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
