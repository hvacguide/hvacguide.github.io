Simply as with switches, somebody might have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Prospect TN</h3>

I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
