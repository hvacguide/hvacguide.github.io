<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
