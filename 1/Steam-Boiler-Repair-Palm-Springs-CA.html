<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems.

<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>

Additional TEAM research studies show that while people are using items including organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high toxin levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>

Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
