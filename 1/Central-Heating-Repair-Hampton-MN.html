<h3>Picking the Right HVAC System For Your Job in Hampton MN</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
