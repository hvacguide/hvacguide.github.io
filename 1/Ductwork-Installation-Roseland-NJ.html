<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
