<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is generally acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is essential to be aware of some of the allergy and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
