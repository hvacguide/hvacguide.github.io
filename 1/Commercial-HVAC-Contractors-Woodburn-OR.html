Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
