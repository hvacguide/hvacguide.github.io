<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
