<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.
