Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less frequent (but typically more serious) cases of individuals ending up being ill after remaining in a specific building at a specific time.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that need to be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
