<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for commercial and residential HVAC businesses. HVAC technicians go through a number of potentially dangerous conditions. Service technicians are frequently needed to operate in confined areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofings of houses.

<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators utilized toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
