<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
