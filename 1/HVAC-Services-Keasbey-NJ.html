Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native.
