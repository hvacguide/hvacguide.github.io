<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
