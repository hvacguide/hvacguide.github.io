<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.
