<p>In addition to these weather condition modifications, we have actually also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last years, adding well over 100,000 individuals, or a development of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In a lot of areas of our country, cooling is a basic need, suggesting the people that move here from out of state are likely expecting to have cooling. Likewise, real estate rates in Seattle have actually escalated, and as a result, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels.

Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
