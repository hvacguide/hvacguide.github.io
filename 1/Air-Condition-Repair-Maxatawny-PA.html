<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
