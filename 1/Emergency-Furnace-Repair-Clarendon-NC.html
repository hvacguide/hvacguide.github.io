<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.

They may spread throughout the entire office or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
