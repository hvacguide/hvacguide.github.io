<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
