Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
