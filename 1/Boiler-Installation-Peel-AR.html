<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people exhale co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, however may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread out throughout the entire workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>
