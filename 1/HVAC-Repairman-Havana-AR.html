<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Havana Arkansas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have fulfilled in a long time.
