The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up.

My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
