<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Hanahan SC</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
