<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.. The so called trustworthy companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night clothing. Due to the fact that I attempted to work for them, I understand. I give up because 90% of them are criminals. They walk in with or without a contract and begin offering you things you do not require.
