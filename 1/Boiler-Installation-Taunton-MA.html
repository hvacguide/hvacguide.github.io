<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
