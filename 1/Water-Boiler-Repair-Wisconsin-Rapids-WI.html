<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
