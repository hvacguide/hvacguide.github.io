EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants show that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels.

These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering the structure.
