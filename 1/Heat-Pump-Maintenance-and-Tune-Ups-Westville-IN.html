<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
