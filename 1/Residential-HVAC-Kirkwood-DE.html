<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise appear soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.)
