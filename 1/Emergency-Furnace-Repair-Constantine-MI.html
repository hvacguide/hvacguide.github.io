<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to trigger health effects differs considerably, from those that are extremely harmful, to those with no recognized health effect.

At present, very little is understood about what health effects take place from the levels of organics typically found in houses.
