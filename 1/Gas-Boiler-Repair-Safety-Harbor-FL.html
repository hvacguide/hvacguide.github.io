Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
