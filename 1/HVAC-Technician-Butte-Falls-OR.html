<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an a/c system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required professional help and consulted various suppliers. Lastly, after a strenuous choice procedure, the space agency chose Dometic. We have actually had a great deal of firsts for many years, however this custom job provided unique challenges for our engineers," stated a spokesperson for Dometic.

<p>The most typical type of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly option, but newer systems can be really energy efficient.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
