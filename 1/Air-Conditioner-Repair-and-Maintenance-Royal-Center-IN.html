<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>A homeowner can effectively find out to do a project such as bleeding and rebooting an oil furnace, but you should be positive that you understand what you're doing.

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
