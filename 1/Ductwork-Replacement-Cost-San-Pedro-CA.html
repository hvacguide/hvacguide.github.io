Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
