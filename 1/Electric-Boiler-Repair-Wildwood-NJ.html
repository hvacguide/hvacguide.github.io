<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.
