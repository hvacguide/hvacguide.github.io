<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
