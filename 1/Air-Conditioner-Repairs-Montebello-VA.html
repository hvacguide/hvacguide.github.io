<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
