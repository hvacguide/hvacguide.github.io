<p>Its special feature is the presence of one main external system that connected to a number of indoor units. Such systems might be the right option for maintaining the microclimate in a number of offices, shops, big home. Simply few of outside units do not aggravate the aesthetic appearance of the building.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
