Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
