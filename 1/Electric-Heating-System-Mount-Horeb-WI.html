<p>Every private residence and small business requires the services of knowledgeable professionals trained in the installation, maintenance, and repair of cooling, refrigeration, and heating unit. The Residential HVAC Service Technician certificate opens lots of doors of opportunity for HGTC graduates.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
