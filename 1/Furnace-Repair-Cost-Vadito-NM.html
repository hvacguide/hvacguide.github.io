<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
