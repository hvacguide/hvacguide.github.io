<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
