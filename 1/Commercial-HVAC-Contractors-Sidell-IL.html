First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
