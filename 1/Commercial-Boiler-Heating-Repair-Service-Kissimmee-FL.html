<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
