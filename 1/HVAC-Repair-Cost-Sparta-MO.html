<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
