<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
