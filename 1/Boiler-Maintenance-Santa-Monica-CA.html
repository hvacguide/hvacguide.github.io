<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Santa Monica CA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such factors include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
