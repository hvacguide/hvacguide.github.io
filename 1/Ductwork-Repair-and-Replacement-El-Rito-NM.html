<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
