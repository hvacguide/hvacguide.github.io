<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
