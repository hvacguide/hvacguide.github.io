<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.

If your house already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to install.<p>
