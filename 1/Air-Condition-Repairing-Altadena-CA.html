<h3>Boiler Heating System in Altadena California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
