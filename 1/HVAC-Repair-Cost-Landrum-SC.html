<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and health centers, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and aircrafts, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
