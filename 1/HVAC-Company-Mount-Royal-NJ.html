Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the quantity (and often quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
