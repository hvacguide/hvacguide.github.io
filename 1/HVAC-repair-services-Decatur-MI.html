<p>Information supplied in this security guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies.

The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Producers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>
