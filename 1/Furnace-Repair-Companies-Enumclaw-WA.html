<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the entire surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in warmth at a lower total temperature-- in some cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit."
