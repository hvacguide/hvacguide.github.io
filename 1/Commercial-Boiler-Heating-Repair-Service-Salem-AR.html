<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance benefit. Since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
