<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, floor and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
