<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger signs connected with direct exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly check out the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the appropriate usage of these items. Use items which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; usage indoors only if the location is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
