<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly tough for your lungs to work correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
