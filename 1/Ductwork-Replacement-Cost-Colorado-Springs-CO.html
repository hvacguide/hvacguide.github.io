<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
