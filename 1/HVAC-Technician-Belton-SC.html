<h3>HVAC Installation in Belton South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
