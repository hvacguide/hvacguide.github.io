PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
