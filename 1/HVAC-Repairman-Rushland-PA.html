<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
