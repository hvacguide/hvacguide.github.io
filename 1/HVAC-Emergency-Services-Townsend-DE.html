<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, especially because we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
