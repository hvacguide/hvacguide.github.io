<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider prospective effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's instructions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
