<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
