<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
