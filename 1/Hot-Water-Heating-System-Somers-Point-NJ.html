<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in covert or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
