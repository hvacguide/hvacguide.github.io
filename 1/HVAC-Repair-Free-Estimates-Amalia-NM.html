<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Once installed, underfloor heating requires virtually no maintenance and includes a thirty years Guarantee for overall peace of mind. The Warmup heating controllers will ensure that your heating runs in the most effective manner either immediately with a Smart WiFi Thermostat, or, if you want, with a programmable thermostat that can be programmed to make sure the heating begins at certain times, giving you the alternative to change it off at night time.<p>
