<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
