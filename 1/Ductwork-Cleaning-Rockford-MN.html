<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Rockford MN</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
