<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Tallevast</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
