<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>

They're great with the communications - phone, text, e-mail! I put allot of value on a small company owner who resides in the neighborhood he services.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work harder and may overheat if the system is too small. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
