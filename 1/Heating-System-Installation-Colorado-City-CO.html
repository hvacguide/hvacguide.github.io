<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
