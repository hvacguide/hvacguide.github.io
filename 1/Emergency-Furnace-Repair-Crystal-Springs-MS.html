<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
