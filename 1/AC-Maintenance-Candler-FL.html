<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic issue like debris obstructing the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing devices, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those components might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new machinery.<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size ac system is a crucial part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to help you with. Here's why buying the right size air conditioning system matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up losing money and energy. And if it's too little, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
