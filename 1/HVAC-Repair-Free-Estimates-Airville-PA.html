<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
