The EPA research study recommended and controlled approaches used on a smaller variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered since these studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>

Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Given that 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has permitted just using plywood and particleboard that conform to specified formaldehyde emission limits in the building of upraised and mobile houses.
