<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your home will not be warmed properly and the system will have to constantly run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
