<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed effects might occur.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning items, construction furnishings, carpets and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
