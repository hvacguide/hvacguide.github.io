<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Martinez CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
