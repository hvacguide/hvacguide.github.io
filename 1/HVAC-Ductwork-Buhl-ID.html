<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
