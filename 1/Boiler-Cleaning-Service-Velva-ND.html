<p>The majority of well and city water does not typically consist of lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only way to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and keep.<p>
