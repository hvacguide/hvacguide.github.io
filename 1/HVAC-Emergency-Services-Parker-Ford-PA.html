<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as health centers and skyscrapers, cars such as vehicles, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
