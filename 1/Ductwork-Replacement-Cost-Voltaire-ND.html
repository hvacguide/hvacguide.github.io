<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Voltaire</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
