<p>You could update to the highest performance gear offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air system.

Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
