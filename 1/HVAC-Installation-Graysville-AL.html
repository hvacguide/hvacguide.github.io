<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system seems less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, heated up floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a significant remodeling task, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heater is a suitable solution for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
