<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Crystal Beach FL</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is stopped up or dirty Before trying to repair any problem, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. Call an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
