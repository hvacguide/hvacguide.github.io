<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
