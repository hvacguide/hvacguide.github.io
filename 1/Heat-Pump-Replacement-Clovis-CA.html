<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
