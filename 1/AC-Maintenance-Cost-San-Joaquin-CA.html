<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
