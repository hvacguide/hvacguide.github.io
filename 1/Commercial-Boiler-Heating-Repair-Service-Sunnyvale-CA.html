Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
