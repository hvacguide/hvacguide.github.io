<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
