<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house.
