After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
