He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great idea to think of energy performance. By picking a central AC unit that has as high of an effectiveness rating as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Effectiveness scores ought to be labeled with all systems. While effective units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated home appliance is an excellent way to enjoy extra comfort.<p>
