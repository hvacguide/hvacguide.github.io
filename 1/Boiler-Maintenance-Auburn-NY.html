<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
