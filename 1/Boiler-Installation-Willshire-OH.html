Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
