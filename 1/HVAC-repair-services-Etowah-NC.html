<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
