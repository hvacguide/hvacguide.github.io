The majority of owners stay with the larger firms after acquisition. Sometimes, the acquisition offers a method for the seller to retire and ensure employees are looked after.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When installing radiant heating, you ought to give severe idea to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well since it conducts and stores heat.
