<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Magnolia MS</h3>
<p>Created to improve manufacturing procedure control in a printing plant, Provider's innovation managed not only temperature level however likewise humidity Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the procedure. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and consequently the quantity of wetness in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The controlled temperature level and humidity helped maintain constant paper measurements and ink positioning. Later on, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Provider Cooling Company of America was formed to meet increasing demand. Gradually, a/c came to be used to enhance comfort in automobiles and homes as well.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
