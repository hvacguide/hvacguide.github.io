Permeable materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
