<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future.
