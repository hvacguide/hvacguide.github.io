<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Dumont NJ</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has suggested that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study indicates that people invest approximately 90 percent of their time inside your home. Thus, for many people, the threats to health may be higher due to exposure to air contamination indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
