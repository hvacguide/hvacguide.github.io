<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room.
