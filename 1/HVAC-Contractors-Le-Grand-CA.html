Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.

Attempt a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
