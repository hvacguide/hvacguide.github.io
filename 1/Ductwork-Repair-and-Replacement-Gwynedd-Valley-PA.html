<p>House owners may also presume that due to the fact that a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a house enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their house's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or adversely affects property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication. Perhaps Realtors should think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking cost. That stated, property buyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
