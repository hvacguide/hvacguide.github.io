As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
