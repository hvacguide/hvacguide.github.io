<h3>Truth About Fillmore CA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Considering that pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is sensible to lower using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside your home. Depending upon the site and pest to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be efficient: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making sure that wooden building products do not come into direct contact with the soil and by saving fire wood far from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be drastically decreased.<p>
