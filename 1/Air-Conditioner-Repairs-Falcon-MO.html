<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Falcon MO</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the ac system before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
