<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other debris result in issues like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms.
