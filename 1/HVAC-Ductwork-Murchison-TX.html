<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Murchison TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
