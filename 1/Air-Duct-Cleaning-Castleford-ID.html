<p>Keep in mind that the SEER score is determined using the exact same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summertime temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the right SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be connected to a gadget known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat created from the ground source heat pump compressor and uses it to heat water. This suggests that this gadget can also offer complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>

But more complex concerns-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 methods listed below may be proper.<p>
