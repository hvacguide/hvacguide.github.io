<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
