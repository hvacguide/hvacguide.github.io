<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
