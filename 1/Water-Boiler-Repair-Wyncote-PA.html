What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
