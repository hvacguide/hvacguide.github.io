<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
