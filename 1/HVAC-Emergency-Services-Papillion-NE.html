<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Papillion NE HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
