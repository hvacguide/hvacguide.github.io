<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.
