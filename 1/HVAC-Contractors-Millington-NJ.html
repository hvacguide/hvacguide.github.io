<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Millington</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations build up indoors.<p>
