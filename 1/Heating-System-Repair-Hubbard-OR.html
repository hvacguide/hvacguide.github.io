<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
