Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very difficult in the beginning, needing specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
