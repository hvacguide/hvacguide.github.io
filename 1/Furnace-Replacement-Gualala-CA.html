My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
