<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
