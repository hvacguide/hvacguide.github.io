<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
