<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.
