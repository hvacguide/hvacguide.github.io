<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Hamlet Indiana</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us for that reason.
