<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
