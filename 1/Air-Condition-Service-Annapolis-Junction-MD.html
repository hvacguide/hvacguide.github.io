<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
