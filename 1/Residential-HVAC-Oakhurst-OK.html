<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations build up indoors.<p>
