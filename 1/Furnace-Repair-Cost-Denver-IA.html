<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a really common repair.
