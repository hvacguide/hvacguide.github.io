<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heatpump is an affordable solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace.

Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
