<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

In an average air-conditioned home, a/c consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, triggering power plants to release about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>There are 2 primary kinds of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This implies that this device can also provide free hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
