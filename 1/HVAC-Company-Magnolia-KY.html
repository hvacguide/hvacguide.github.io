<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.
