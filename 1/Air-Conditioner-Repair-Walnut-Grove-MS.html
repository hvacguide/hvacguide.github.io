<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
