<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
