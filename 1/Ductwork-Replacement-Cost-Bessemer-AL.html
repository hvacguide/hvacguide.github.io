<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
