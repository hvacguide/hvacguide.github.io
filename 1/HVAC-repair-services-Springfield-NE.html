<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
