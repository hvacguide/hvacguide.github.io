<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Routine assessment and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and extends its life.<p>
