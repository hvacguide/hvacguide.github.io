<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
