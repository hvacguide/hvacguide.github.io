<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
