Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
