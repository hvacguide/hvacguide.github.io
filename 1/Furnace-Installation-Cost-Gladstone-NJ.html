<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a vehicle radiator or common home air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
