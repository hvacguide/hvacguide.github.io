He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
