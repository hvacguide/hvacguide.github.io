<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
