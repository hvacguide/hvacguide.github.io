<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Rolesville NC</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be examined a minimum of two times annually for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
