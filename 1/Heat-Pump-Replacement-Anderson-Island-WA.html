<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Anderson Island WA</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
