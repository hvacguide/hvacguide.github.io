<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration. Generally, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
