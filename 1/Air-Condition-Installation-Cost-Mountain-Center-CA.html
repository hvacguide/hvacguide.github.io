<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
