<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system.

When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
