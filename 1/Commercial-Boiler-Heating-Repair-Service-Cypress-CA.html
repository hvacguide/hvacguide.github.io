Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
