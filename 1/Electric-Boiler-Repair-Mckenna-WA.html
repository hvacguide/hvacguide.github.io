<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Mckenna WA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
