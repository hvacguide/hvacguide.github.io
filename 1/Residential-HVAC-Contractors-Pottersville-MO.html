<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.
