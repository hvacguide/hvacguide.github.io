<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
