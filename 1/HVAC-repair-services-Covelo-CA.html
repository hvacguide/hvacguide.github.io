<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
