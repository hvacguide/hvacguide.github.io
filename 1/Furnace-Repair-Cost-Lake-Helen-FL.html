<p>The reality is, air pollution in your house can be just as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American spending 87% of their life inside, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd become aware of more often. However do not panic!

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>We typically set up small integrated electric area heating units when we remodel or include on a space. Unlike heatpump, these systems are self-contained.

They come in several forms: wall-mounted units that are excellent for little spaces like restrooms, cove heating systems that resemble baseboard heating systems but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that provide a gentle sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
