Many common building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.

A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is typically suggested instead.<p>
