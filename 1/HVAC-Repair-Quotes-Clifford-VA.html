<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Clifford VA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
