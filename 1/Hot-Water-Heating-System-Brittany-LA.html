He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
