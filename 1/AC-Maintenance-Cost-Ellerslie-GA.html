I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
