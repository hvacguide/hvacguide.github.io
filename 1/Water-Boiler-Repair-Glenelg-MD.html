<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
