<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Pomeroy PA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
