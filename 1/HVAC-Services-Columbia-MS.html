<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
