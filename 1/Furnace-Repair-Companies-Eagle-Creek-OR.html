<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
