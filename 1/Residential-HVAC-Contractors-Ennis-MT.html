After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
