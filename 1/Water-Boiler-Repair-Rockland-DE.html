<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
