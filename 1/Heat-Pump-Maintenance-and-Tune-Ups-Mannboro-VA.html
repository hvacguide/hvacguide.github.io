<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
