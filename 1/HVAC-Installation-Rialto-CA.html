<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
