<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
