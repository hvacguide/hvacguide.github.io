<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Willow Spring NC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
