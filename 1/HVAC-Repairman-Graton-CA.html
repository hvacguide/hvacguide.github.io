<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and should be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
