<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heating system over a traditional forced air heating unit. Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heating units, for something. Required air heater tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output. Forced air heater likewise tend to generate hot and cold areas throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>As you typically need to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heater, you must consider the time it takes for this to totally dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is normally a day or 2. The water-based underfloor heating takes longer to put in location, although this does not normally matter too much as it tends to be set up as part of a larger structure or renovation project and installation is completed within a week generally.<p>
<p>Gas furnaces do include some disadvantages. The most significant downside is also the outcome of the combustion process. This process releases exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide gas, which need to be vented to the beyond the house.

What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
