<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
