<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
