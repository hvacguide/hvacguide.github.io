<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops vary outside of an acceptable variety that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
