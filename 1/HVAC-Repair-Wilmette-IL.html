<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main issue in over half the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually conducted. Examinations carried out in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
