In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous results, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems.

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
