<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on private level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>

However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans exhale co2, which in small amounts is not toxic, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the entire office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
