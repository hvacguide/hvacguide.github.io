<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC.
