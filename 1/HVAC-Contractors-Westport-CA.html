<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
