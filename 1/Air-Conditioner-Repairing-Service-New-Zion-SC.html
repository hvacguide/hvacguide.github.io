<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of houses in cooler environments were heated up by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors warmed. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
