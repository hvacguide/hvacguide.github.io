<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based upon the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your automobile, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid issues, and keep your guarantee intact.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working effectively, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
