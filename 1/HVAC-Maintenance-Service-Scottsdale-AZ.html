<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
