<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
