<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, consider prospective impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's instructions, specifically instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
