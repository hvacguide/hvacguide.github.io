<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to increase and flow out high structure openings to the outside (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings.

In warm or humid climates, preserving thermal comfort solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outdoors air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>
