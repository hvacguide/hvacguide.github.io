<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
