<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Twin Lake MI</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
