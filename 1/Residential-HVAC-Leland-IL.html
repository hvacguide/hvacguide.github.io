<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
