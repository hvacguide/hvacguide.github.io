<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
