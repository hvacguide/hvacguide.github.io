<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Job in Marmora NJ</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
