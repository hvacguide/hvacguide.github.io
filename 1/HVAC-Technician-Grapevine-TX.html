<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can affect a person's comfort, capability, and health to work. It can include temperature, humidity, absence of outside air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does supply guidelines about the most common IAQ workplace complaints.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
