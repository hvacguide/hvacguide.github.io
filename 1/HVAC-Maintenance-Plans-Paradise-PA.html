<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on.
