<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, given that the system is combined.
