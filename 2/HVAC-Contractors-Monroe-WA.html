<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furnishings and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
