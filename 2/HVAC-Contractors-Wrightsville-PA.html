<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by a lot of public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, call a lab accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
