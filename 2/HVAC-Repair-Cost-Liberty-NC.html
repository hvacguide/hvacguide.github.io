<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Improper adjustment, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas stove or variety. Never use a gas stove to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
