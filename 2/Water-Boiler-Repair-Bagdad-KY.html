<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
