<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd issue that sometimes comes up. When you do see your furnace behaving oddly, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to concerns with your furnace, the much easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will only make the problem worse, and typically more costly.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
