<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Grandview MO Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
