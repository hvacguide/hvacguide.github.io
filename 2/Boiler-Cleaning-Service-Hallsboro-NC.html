<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
