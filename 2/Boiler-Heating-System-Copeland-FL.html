<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
