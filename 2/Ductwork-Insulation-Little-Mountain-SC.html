<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Consider possible results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
