<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future.

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
