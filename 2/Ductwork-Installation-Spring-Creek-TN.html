<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
