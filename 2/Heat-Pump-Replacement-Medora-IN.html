<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
