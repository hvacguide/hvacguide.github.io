<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
