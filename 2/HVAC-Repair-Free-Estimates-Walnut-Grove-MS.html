<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
