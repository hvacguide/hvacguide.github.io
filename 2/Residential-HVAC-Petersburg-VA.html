<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
