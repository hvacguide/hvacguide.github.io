<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes.

Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat. He included these small however significant modifications in his quote. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
