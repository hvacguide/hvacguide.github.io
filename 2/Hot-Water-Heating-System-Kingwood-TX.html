<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing slightly gradually as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual.
