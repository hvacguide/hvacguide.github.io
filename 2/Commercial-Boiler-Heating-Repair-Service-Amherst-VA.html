<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Amherst VA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
