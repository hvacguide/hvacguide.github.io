<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
