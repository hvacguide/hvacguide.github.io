<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
