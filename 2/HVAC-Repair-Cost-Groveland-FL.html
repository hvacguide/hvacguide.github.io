<h3>Commercial HVAC in Groveland FL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
