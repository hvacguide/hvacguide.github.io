It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
