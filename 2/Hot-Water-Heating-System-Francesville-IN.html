However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
