<h3>Truth About Westwood NJ Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is typically used in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
