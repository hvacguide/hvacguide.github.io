Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
