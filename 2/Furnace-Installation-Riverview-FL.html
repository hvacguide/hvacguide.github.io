<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>

A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to guarantee all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
