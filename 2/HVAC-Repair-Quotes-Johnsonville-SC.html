Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
