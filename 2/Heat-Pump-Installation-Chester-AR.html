However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
