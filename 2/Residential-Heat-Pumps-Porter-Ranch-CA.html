<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
