Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
