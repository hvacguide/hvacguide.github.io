My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have ended up being reasonably adept at investigating items on line prior to acquiring them. However I do not find that there is a central area for searching info about the "true" value of home HVAC systems or maybe I should state an honest evaluation of these products.
