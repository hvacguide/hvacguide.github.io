<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

Note: Constantly shut off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Fort Washington Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a simple issue like particles clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control.
