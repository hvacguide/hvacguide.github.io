<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
