<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
