<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
