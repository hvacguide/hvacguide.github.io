<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions.

ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
