<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
