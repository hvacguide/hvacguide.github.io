<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
