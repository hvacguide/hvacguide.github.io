<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes effectively, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drainage pipes triggers a water leakage. There are several places a clog can occur. One of the main areas where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
