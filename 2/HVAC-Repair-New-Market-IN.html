<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in New Market IN</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants given off by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These elements consist of poor ventilation (lack of outdoors air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure. Often, specific contaminants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
