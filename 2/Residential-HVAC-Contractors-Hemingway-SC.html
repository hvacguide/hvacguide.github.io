<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
