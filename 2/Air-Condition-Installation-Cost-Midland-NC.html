<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
