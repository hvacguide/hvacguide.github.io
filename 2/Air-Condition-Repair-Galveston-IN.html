To make certain the system you pick is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the specific kind of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size system you currently have.

This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

Children might have higher exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
