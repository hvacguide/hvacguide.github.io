<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
