<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
