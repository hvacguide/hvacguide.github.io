<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
