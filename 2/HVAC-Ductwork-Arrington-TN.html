<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Arrington TN</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not pose a significant health threat by themselves, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
