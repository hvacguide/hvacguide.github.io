To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently.
