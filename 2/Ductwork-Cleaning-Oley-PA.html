<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
