<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
