<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
