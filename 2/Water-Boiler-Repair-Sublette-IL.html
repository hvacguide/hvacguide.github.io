Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
