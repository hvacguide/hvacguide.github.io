<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Drayton South Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
