<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is vital to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas).

The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
