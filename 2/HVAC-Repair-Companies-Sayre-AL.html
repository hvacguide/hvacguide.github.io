<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Sayre Alabama</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite costly. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
