<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
