<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
