<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
