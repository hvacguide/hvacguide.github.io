<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
