<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not restricted to houses. In truth, many office complex have considerable air contamination sources Some of these structures might be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be designed or operated to supply sufficient quantities of outdoor air.

As an outcome, there has actually been an increase in the incidence of reported illness.<p>
