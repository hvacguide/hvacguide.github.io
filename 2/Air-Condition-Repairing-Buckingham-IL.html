<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
