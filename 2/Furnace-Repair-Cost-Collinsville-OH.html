<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
