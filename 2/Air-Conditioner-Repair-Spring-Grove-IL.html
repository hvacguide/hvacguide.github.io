<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
