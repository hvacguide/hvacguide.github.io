They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to purchase it. My wife said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.
