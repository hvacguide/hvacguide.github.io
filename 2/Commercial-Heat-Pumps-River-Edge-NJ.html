<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To discover smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
