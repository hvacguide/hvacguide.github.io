<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
