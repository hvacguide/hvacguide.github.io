<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>
