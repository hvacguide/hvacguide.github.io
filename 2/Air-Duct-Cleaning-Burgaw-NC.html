<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and located ways we could have more even heat.
