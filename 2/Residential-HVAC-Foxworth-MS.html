<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
