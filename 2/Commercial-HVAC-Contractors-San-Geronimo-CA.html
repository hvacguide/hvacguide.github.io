<p>Normally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, consider prospective effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
