Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality.
