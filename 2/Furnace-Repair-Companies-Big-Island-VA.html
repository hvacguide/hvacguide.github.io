Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
