<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
