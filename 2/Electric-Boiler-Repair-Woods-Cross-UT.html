<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Woods Cross UT</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
