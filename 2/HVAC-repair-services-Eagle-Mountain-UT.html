<p>Specific instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to take notice of the time and location the signs take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
