<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
