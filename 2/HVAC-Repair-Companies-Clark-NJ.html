<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
