He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
