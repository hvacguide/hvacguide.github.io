<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
