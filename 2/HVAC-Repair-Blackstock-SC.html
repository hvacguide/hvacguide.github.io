<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
