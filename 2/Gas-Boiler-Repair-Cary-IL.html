It takes very little time to warm up or cool off your house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before.

<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
