While weatherization is underway, however, steps ought to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>
