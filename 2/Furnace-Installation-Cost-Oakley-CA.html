In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and tenancy) must be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be handy. Leakages need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be removed, also. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
