<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a uncomplicated and effective  technique to minimize ambient air contamination and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
