<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
