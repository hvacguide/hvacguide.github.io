<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Harbor City CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
