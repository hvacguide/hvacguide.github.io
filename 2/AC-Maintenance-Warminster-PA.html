<h3>HVAC Company Near Me in Warminster PA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
