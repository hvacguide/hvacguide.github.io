<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological threat to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Prior to it was known how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
