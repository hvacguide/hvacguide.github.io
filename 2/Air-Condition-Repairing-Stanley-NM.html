<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Environment Pro is reputable and truly cared about us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right before a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
