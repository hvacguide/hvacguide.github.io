<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & decided to go with them for the work.

Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, courteous and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
