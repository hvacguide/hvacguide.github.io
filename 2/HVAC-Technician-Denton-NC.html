<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
