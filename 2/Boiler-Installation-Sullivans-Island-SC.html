<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
