<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
