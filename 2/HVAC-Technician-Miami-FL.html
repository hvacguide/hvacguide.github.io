<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous common building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
