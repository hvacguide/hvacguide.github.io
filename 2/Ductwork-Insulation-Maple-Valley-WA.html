<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Maple Valley</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can differ considerably from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance task may need completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked.

Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up till several years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task websites.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
