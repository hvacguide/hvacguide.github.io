<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
