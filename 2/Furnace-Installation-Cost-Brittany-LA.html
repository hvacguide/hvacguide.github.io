<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
