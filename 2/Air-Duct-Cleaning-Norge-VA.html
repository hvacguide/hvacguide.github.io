<h3>Ductwork Replacement Cost in Norge VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c may end up being very unclean. These aspects of the equipment are vital for efficient air conditioning.
