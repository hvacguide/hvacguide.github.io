In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
