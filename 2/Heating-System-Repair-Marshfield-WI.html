Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater.
