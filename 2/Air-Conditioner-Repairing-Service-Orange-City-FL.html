<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
