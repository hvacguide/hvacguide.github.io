<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly satisfying individual to have around that whole time. His time and competence to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual need to be called for almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Cross Hill SC Home Owners</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
