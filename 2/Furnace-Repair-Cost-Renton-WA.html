<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
