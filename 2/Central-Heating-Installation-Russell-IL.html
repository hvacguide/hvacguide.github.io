<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair at Russell IL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
