<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
