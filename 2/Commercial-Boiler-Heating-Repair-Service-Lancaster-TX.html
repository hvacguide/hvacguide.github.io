<h3>Heat Ventilation in Lancaster TX</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
