<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
