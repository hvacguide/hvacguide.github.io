<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Monterey CA?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally happen. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
