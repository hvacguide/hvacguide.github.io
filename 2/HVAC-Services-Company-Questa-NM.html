<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roof or on a concrete piece next to your home's foundation. This kind of a/c also is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from inside through the home's exterior wall or roofing to get in touch with the packaged air conditioner, which is usually located outdoors. Packaged a/c typically include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of air conditioning system and central heater removes the requirement for a different furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
