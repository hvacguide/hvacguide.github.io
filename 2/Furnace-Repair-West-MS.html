<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Because an ac system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil.
