<p>While toxin levels from individual sources may not posture a significant health risk on their own, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid new issues from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Our service technicians are trained, experienced and licensed to set up, preserve and repair residential and commercial heating, air and ventilation conditioning devices and to tidy and inspect your chimney or ventilation shaft.

<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
