<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical earnings for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Heavy production industries employ a fairly small percentage of air conditioning technicians and other HVAC workers, however pay some of the market's greatest salaries. Electrical power producing companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 each year.

Trains are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
