<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a brand-new gas stove or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
