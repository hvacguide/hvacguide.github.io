<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
