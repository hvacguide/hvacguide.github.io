<p>To determine the right size of oil furnace you require for your home, determine the home's square footage and identify what zone your home remains in. Consult the U.S. Energy Info Administration's climate zone map to determine your zone number. Multiply the length and width of each space in your house that you heat and build up all the spaces together to get your overall square footage.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
