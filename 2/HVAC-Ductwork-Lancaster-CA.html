<h3>Truth That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Lancaster CA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
