Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
