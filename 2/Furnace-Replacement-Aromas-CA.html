<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
