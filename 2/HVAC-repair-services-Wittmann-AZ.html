<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Numerous aspects affect IAQ.
