<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.. The so called respectable companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night attire. I understand because I attempted to work for them. Since 90% of them are scoundrels, I quit. They walk in with or without a contract and start selling you things you do not need. They lie.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electricity. The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
