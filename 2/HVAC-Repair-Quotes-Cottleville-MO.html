<h3>Choosing the Proper Business For Heating and AC Systems in Cottleville MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
