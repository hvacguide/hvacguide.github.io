<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
