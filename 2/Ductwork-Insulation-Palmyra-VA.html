<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, particularly since we spend most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
