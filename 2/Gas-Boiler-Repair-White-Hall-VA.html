<p>New air conditioners usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score means higher energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy bills.

<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in White Hall VA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners.

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
