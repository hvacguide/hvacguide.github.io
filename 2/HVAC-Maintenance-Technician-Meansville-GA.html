<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
