<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Allendale MI</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally occur when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is improperly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
