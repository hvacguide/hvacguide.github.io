The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
