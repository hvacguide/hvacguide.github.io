<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
