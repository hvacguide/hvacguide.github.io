<p>A specialized ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Space ac system include a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which measures the temperature of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the air conditioner might cycle constantly or behave erratically. The sensing unit should be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
