<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by many public water supplies, it has actually been discovered in well water.

<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
