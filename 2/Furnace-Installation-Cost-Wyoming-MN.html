(Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
