<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
