<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
