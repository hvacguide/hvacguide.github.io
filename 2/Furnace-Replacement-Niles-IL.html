<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
