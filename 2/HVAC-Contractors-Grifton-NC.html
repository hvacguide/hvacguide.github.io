<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
