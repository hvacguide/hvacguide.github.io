<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
