Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the house.

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the elimination of heat. Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a complimentary cooling system which utilizes pumps to flow a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
