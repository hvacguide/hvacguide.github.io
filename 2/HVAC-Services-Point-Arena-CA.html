<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are moist or damp structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and family plants.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in chillier climates were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the walls, floors and ceilings heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
