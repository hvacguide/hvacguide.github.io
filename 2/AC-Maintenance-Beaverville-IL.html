<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heaters While oil is generally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the 2 types.

Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
