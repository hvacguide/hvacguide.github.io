<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Lakewood</h2>

Load computing is described as the Handbook J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your home likewise depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
