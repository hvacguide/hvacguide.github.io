<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
