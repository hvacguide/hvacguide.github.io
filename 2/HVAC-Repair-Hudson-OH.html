<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Hudson OH</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
