The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your house's systems.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
