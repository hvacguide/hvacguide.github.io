Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very effective thermal barrier.
