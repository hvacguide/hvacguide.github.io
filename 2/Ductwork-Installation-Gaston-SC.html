<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
