<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

Children might have higher exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
