Breathing air contaminants can result in allergic and asthmatic responses, infections and other health issue that include the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy.

However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home.
