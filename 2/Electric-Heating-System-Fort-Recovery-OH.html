<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
