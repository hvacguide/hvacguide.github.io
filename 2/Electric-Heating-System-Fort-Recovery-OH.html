Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
