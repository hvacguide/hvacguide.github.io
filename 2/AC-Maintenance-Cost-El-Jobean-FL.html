<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
