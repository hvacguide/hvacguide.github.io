Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
