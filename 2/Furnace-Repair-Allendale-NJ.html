<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
