<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Starr SC</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is blocked or filthy Before attempting to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Contact a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
