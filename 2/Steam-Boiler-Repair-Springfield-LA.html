<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
