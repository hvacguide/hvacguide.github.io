<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
