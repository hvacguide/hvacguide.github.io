Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
