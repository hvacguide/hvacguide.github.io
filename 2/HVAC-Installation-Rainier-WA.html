<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system.
