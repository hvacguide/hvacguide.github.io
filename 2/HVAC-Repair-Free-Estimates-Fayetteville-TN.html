<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
