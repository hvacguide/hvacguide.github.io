<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
