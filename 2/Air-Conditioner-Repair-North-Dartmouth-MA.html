<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

For instance, people breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, however may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria may likewise exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
