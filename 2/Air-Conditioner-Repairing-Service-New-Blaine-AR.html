<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
