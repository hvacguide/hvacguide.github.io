<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
