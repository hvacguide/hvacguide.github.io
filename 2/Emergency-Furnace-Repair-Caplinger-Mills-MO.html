<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
