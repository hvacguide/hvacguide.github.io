<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Gerton NC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Gerton NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
