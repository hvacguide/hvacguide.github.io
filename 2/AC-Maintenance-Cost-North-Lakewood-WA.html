<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
