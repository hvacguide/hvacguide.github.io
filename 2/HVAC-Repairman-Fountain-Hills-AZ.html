The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
