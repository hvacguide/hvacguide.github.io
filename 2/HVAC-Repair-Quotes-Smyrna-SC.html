<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
