<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the examination on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health danger factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new homeowner I have found out how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
