We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
