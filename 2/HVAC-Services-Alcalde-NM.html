<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Alcalde NM</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

Next time it rains, inspect your rain gutters. If you see water leaking out of end caps, flowing on the outdoors, or leaking behind them, it's time to go out the ladder.<p>
