<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Because heating and cooling work might also need setting up or repairing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumber's license or have a licensed plumbing on call.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
