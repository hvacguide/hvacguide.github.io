<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
