<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside the house's structure. This type of air conditioning unit also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside your home through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged ac system, which is usually located outdoors. Packaged air conditioning unit often consist of electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of a/c and central heating unit removes the requirement for a separate furnace inside.<p>
