<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
