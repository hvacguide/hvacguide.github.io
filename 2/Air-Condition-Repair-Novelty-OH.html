A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
