<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.
