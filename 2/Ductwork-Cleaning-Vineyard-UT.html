Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect.
