<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Jefferson City TN</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
