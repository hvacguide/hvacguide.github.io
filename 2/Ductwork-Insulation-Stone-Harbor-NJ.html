<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
