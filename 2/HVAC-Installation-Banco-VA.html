<p>People with asthma have respiratory tracts that are really twitchy or sensitive. These respiratory tracts might react to things that can (or cause) asthma signs When a person with asthma takes in an asthma trigger, their respiratory tracts might swell up, tighten up, and produce excessive mucus The individual may then start to wheeze or cough, and might establish blockage, scratchy eyes, or a runny nose. Because of this, it is very important for people with asthma to find out what their asthma triggers are and find out methods to manage them.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
