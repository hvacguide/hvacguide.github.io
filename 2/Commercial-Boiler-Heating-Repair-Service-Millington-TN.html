<h3>AC Technician in Millington TN</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were polite and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily individuals who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss out on detail that produces a job effectively done. I really extremely suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure residents might be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the kind of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning products, building activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
