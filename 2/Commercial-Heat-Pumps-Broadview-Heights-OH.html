The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Follow the instructions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
