<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was initially driven by increasing energy expenses, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are a number of techniques for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
