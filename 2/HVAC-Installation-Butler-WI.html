<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
