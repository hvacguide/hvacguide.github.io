<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
