<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can vary significantly from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task may need totally different actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked. Installations can also vary considerably, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In many cases, totally new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (houses normally utilize in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
