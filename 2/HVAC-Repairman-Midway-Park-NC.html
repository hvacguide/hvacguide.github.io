<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short biking in really cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm environment for your home when the weather is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and choose to install it in your house, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions readily available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house is located, the local area's environment can alter dramatically. A home located in the South would require an AC system with a size efficient in cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much larger heating capability also which will impact costs.
