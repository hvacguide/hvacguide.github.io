<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in White House TN</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that pays for itself throughout the years, but just if you secure it to the very best of your ability. Fortunately, this does not have to be a task! When you register for a Keefe's maintenance plan, we take care of everything. No matter what make or model of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual evaluations, discounted diagnostics, priority service, and remarkable offers on repairs and replacements. Pick between our bronze, gold, platinum, and silver plans, and we'll supply you with the greatest level of protection and maintenance.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
