<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
