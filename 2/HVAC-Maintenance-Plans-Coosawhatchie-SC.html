<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
