<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Fort Thomas Kentucky</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated up in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, consequently cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide dependable and consistent heating & cooling.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
