<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, however they can be useful in more remote areas where energies are more difficult to access, and in cooler climates because it offers more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, however energy expenses will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heating systems. They require a storage tank on the immediate home and more maintenance. In general, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
