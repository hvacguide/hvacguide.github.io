<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
