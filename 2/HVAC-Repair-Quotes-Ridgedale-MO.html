<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
