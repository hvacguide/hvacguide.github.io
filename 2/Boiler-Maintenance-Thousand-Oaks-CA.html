<p>Rising energy costs are not the only factor for high bills. Heating systems often lose their performance as they age, specifically if they have not been correctly kept. As an outcome your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to offer the same quantity of heat. This will cause your energy costs to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies every month could be used to help you pay for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
