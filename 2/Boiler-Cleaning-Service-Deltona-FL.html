<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Typically they were initially thinking about remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to provide a much healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions connected with indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
