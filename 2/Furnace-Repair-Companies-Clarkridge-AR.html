<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
