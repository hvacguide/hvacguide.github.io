<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical power, a heatpump is a cost-effective option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse.

<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

An expert technician will inspect the thermostat during the annual maintenance to ensure the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches.
