<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
