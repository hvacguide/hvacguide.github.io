<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
