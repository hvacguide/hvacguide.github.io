<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
