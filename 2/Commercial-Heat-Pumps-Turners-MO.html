Simply as with switches, somebody may have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on.

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the entire system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
