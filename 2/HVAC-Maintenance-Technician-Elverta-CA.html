<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
