<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the spaces. The majority of modern-day warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
