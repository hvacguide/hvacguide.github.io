<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, disorientation and nausea. The impacts of CO exposure can differ significantly from person to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
