<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
