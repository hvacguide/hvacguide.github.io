<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until many years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought home from task sites.<p>
