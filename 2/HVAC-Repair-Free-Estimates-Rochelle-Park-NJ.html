For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
