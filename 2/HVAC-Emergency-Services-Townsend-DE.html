<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized building products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the threat likewise originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the establishing world.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
