<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines.

<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
