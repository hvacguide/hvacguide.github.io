<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not just will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can likewise lead to duct leaks due to extreme air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
