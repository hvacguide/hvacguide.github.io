<p>Let's begin by outlining the preparation that needs to take place before you in fact buy a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your house isn't as simple as choosing one off a showroom flooring. Not all heaters are good for all homes, and there are a number of elements that definitely need to be considered before selecting one. Initially, you'll need one that is appropriately sized for your home. A furnace that is too big will put out too much heat for your system to handle, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to provide enough heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
