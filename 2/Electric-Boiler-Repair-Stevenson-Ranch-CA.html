<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Stevenson Ranch CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Before you choose a contractor, think about bids from at least 3 to five trusted contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no consumer grievances have been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active.

Keep in mind that energy-star ranked devices will conserve you cash in the end however may involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
