Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
