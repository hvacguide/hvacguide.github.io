Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid too.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
