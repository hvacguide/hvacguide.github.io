<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
