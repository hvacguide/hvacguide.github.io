<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
