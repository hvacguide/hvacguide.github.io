<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air unit. In truth, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong recommendation not to do so. Anticipate to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air if you do take our suggestion. In addition, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for additional materials and devices.<p>
<p>Initially, understand that a bulk of your central air and system cost will originate from the system itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually go beyond $10,000 for bigger houses.
