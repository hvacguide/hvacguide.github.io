Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Lowell MA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
