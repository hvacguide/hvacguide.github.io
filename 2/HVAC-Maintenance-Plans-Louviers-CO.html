<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
