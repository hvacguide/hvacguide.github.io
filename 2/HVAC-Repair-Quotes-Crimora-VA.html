And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered great customer care at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
