<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
