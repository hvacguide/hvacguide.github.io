<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue.

A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
