<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
