<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space.
