<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
