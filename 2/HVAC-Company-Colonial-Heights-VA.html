<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Colonial Heights VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Colonial Heights VA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
