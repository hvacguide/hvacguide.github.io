Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
