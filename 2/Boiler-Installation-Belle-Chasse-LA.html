<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
