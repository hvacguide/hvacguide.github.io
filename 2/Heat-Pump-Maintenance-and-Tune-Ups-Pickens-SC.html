<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful.
