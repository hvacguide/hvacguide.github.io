<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty stipulation" applies.

Other signs might be regular dust build-up, static shocks, sagging plants, furniture breaking and musical instruments that do not stay in tune.

Poor indoor air quality might also not be related to on old furnace, bad ventilation and other reasons can cause it, too.
