<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used.

Nevertheless, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
