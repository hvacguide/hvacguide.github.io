<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up.

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>You must constantly hire a professional to perform AC repair, for the exact same reason that you trust an expert plumber or electrician.
