<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
