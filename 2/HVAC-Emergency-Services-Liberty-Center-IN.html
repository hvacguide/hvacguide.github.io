<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
