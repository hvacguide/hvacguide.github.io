<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
