<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
