Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
