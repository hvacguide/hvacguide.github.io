<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.
