<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered exceptional, tailored, mindful, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, reliable and engaging. He clearly and thoroughly discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me confident in his ability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not have to sustain another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He likewise responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to an issue that could not be dealt with on the first see due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
