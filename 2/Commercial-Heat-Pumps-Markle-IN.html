<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
