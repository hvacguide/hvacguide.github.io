<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
