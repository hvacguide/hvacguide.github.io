<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and keep.<p>
