Examine the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Call a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
