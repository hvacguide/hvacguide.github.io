<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
