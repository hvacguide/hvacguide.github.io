These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
