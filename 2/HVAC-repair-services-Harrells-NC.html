<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Harrells NC</h3>
<p>The majority of people do not understand how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining properly. A restriction in your drainage pipes triggers a water leak. There are several places an obstruction can take place. One of the main areas where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
