<p>Self-installation tends to develop more issues than it resolves.

Let G & S Heating Cooling & Electric handle the whole HVAC installation procedure from the start, and you'll never ever have to stress over it being done improperly.<p>

<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Poneto IN HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
