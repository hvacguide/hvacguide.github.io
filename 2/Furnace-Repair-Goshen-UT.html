<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater seems less like a high-end item and more like a requirement.
