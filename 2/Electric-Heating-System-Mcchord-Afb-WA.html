Your furnace has lots of elements that can affect the health and wellness of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide assurance that it is safe to operate. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Assessment of your furnace consists of a Health & Safety Analysis, which checks the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide gas leakages and contaminated breathing air), checks the pilot security (surge threat), checks the high limit (fire threat) and includes a visual inspection for other dangers. In truth, our Security Assessment includes 10 separate security checks of your system.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning system includes 2 primary parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioners count on a set of pipes to link the outdoor to the inside air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split air conditioner installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to create either heated or cold air.<p>
