<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Senoia GA</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
