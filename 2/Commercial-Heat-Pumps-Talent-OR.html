<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
