<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

Because it has actually restored my faith in great production, am glad I got this however. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got given that I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just ideal.<p>
