<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
