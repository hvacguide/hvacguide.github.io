While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
