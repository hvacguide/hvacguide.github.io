<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Attica IN</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
