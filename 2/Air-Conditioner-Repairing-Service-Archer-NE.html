This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
