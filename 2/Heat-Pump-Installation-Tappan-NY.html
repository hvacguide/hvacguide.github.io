<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
