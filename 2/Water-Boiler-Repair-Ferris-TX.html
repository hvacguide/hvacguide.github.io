<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
