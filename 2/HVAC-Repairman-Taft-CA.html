<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Taft CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.
