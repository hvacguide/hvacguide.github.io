<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
