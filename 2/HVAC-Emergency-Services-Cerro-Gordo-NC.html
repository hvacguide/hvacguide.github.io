<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
