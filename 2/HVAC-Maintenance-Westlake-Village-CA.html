They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
