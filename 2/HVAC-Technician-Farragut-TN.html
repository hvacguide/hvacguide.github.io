Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
