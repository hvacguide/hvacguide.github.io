<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many units include a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and safe fit in the window opening. And for extra support, particularly for larger a/c, think about acquiring a steel support bracket and mount it to the outdoors house wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
