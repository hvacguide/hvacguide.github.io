<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
