<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
