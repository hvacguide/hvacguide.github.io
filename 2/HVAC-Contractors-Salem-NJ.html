<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Lots of common structure products used before 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not always ideal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>
