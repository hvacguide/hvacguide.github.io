<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space a/c offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
