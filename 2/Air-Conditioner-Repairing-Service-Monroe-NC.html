<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
