Most of the time, this just consists of some buildup of dirt and particles, which is quite easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They might advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to ensure appropriate airflow around the system.<p>
