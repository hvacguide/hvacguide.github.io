<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be wiser to change the entire system.<p>
