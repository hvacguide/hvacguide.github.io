<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional A/cs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off private spaces when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and lower their temperature quickly, conserving you energy and money that routine HVAC compressors will waste by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
