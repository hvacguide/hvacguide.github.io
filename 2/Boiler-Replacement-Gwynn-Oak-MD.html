<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.
