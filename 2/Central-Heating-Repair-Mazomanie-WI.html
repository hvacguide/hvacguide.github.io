A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.
