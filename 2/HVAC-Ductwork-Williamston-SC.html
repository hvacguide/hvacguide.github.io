<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly.

Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
