<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
