<h3>Furnace Cleaning in San Quentin CA</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
