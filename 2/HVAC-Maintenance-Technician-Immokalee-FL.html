<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
