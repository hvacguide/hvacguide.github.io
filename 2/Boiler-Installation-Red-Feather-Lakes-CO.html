One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to withstand existing, which then produces heat.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
