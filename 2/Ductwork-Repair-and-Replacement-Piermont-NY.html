<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I have actually got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used all over the world, consisting of EMV.

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts however the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
