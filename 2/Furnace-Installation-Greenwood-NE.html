<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
