Many typical building materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination procedure, removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly optimum. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is often suggested instead.<p>
