<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological contaminant. Biological pollutants in the house may include mold, bacteria, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can cause allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Signs triggered by biological toxins consist of sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, dizziness, and breathing infections.<p>
