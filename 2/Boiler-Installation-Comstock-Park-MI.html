Due to the fact that they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
