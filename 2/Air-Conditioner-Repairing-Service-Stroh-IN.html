<p>Property owners may also presume that since a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication. Maybe Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may add to, or deduct from, any offered asking cost. That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
