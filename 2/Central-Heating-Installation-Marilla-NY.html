<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
