<h3>Solar Heating System in Oradell NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
