As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

Low-cost craftsmanship is normally shoddy craftsmanship, and it never assists a company build long-term relationships with clients.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
