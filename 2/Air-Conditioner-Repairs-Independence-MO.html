<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Independence MO</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
