<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window.
