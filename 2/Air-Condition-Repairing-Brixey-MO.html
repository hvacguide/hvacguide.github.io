<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
