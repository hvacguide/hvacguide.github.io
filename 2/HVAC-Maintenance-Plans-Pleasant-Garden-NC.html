<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Pleasant Garden NC - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
