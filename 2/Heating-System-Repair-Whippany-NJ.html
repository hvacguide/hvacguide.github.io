<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
