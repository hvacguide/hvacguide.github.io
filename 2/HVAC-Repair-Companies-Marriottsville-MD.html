<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
