<p>For example, pollutants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it might serve as a pathway to carry the contaminants inside.

A small house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
