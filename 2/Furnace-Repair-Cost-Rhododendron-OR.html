<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The primary threat of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious breathing illness.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Rhododendron OR</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>To begin, it's an excellent idea to consider energy performance. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Effectiveness ratings should be labeled with all units. While efficient systems may cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated appliance is a terrific method to enjoy extra comfort.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
