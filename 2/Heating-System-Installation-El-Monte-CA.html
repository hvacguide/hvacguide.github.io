<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
