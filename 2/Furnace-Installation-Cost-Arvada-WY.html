After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance.

Ventilation, a typical method of minimizing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, likewise will lower but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking cigarettes produces such large amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Consequently, the most reliable method to reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
