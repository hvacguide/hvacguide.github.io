<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
