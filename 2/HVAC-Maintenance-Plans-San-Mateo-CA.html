Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person need to be required nearly any maintenance other than routine cleaning.
