One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface.

The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
