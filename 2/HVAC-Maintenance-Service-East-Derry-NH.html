<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
