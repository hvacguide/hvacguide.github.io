<p>. Before picking the installation area of ac system, several primary aspects need to be thought about. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outside unit should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the performance of the whole system will drop sharply. It is highly recommended to set up the air conditioner systems in easily accessible places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
