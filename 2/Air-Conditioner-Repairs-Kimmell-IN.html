<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Robaire has been my choice considering that I have ended up being a property owner over 18 years earlier. They have actually set up 2 Trane heating & a/c systems to keep our entire house comfy. They also perform all service work on my rental properties also. Their techs show up when they state they will and the rates is competitive.
