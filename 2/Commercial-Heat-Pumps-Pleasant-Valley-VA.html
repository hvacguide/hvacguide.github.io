<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Pleasant Valley VA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
