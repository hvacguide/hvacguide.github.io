<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
