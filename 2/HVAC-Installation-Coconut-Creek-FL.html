<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
