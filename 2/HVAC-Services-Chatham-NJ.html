<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
