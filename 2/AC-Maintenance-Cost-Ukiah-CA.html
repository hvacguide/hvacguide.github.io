<h3>AC Unit Repair in Ukiah CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

However, it is not always true that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed effects might occur.<p>
