<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
