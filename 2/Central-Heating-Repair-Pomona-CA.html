Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and reliable  approach to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>While toxins typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness.
