<p>Many people understand that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have substantial, harmful impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five environmental health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating System in Cumming GA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
