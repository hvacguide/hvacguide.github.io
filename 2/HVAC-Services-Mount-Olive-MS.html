For this reason, it is necessary to take note of the time and place symptoms happen. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the location, for instance, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to significantly minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. Consequently, the most reliable method to decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking cigarettes there.<p>
