Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

But more complex concerns-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below may be appropriate.<p>
