ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
