<p>Forced air systems are the most common heater types on the marketplace, however they're not always the best option for each house. If you're looking for a new heating system for your house, you must have a look at a few of the other options readily available before deciding on a system that might not fit your requirements best.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you buy. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating options. This suggests it can warm up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Many modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
