<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
