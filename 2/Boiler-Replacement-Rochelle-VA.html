<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
