<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Lastly, make sure the thermostat is working and positioned properly.

Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold if this takes place.
