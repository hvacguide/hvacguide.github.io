<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video.
