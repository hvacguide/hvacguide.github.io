Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
