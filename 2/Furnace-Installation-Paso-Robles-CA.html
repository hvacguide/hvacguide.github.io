<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and eco-friendly than traditional HVACs. This is because you can shut off private spaces when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and reduce their temperature quickly, saving you energy and cash that routine HVAC compressors will waste by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-term corrosive concerns.

She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
