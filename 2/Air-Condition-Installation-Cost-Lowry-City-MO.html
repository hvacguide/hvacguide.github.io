<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
