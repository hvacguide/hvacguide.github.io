<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
