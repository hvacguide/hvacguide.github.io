<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Rialto CA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring heats the lower half of the room, covering occupants in heat at a lower general temperature level-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating unit." To put it simply, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
