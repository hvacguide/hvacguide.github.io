Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and large homes. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
