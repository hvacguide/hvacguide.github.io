Buildings constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing a little over time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned up, collects dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.
