<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
