<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
