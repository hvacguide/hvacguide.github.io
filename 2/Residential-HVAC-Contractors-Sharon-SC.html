<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
