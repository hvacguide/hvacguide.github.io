<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we provide suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home might not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To identify smells in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
