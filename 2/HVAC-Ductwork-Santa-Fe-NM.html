Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
