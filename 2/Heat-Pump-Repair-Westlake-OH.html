<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Westlake OH?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
