<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
