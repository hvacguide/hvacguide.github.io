<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
