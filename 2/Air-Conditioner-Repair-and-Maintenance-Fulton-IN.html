<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
