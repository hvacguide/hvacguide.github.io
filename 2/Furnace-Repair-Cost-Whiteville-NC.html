<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
