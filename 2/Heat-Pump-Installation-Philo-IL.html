<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. Another aspect of the job is encouraging clients regarding how to prevent future issues and properly preserve equipment by, for example, regularly oiling parts or altering filters.

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
