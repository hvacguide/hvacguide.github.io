<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products.

This can result in the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
