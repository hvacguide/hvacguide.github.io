<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
