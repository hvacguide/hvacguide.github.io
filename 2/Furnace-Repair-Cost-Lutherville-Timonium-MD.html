<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
