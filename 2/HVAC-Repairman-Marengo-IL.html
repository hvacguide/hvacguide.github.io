<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Marengo IL</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
