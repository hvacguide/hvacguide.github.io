<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate.
