<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and reliable  approach to lower ambient air contamination and potential health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them.
