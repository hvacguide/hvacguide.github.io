<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air).
