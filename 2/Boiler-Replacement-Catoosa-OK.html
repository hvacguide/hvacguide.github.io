<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Catoosa OK?</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
