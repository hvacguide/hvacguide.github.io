<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
