<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the toxin source far from residents and even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at South Prairie WA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
