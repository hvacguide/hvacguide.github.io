<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification innovations are ending up being more typical as readily available services in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles.
