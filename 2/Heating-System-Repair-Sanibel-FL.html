He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
