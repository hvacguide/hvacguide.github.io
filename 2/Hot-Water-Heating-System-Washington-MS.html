<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
