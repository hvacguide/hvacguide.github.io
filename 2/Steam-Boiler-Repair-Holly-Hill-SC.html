<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Holly Hill SC?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
