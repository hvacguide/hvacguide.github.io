<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
