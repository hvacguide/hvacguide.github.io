<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Gentry AR</h3>
<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
