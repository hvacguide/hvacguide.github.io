Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
