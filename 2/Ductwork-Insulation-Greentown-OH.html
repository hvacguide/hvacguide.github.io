If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up.
