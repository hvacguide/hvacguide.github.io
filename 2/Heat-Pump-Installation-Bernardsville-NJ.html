Area control involves moving the contaminant source far from residents or even relocating prone occupants.<p>

<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
