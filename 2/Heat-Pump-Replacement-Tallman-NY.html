<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently.
