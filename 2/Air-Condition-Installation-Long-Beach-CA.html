<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
