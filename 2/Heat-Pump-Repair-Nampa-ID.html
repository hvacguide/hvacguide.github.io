Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Nampa Idaho</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
