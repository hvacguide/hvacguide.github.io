Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
