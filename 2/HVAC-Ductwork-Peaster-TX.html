<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
