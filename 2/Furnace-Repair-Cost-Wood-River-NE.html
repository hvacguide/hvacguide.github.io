<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account when purchasing a new AC system. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
