<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water supplies, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated.

<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

There are several methods for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. Most contemporary warm water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
