Temperature levels ought to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air blood circulation must be prevented.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
