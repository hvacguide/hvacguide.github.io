Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
