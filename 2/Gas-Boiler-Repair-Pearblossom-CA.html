<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978.

Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level.
