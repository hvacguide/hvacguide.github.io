<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>
