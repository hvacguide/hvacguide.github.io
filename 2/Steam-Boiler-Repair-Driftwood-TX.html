<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation business totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living.

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever used due to long-lasting destructive concerns. Essentially all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and is available in long lengths, which enable PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and ought to be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
