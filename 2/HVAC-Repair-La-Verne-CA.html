<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in La Verne CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
