<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
