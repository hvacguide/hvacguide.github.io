Due to the fact that they only partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
