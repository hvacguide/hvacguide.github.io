<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
