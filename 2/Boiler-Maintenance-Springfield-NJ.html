<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
