<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.
