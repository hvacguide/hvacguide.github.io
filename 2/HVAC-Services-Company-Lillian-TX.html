<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
