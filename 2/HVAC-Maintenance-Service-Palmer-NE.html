<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Palmer NE</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
