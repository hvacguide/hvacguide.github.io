Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
