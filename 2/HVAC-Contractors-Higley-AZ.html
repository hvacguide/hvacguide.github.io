<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation service completely flip on its head the last couple of years.

Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
