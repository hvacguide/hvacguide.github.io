<p>New a/c unit usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking implies higher energy effectiveness and possibly lower energy bills.

<h3>A Look At Ductwork In Cedar Falls IA Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever technology. Martin said the company can establish a control panel within the structure's controls that will provide data on its systems to permit real time presence, supplying the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not just throughout brand-new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
