Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
