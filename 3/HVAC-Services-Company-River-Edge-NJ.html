<h3>Pool Heat Pump in River Edge NJ</h3>
<p>We required two sees - Jake came out initially and was extremely knowledgeable and enjoyable and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later on and was also knowledgeable and good to speak with. They both did a great job. Sabre's workplace staff is really handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Definitely recommend.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided terrific customer care at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the most significant energy customers in your house, so property owners who may be shopping for a brand-new furnace ought to considering replacing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to save money and assist the environment. The average furnace lasts in between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a significant investment in your home. Spend wisely by learning as much as you can about offered alternatives.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
