<p>There are a couple of main points that property owners will wish to take into consideration when choosing which of the best AC units they must set up in their homes.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
