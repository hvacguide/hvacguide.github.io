<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>There is no simple response, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
