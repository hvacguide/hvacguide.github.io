<p>You're motivating the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
