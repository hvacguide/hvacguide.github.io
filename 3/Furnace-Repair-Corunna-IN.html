<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The people working at Target aren't lazy or dumb and in this service all it takes is one small crack in your securities and somebody will discover it and pry you broad open, often in just a couple of days.

This is no longer the realm of the only hacker but rather worldwide, the mob and they are better funded and staffed than any of us could ever be.<p>
