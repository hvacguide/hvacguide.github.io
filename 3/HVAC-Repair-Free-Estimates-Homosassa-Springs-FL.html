<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
