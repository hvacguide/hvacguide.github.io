<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized structure materials, furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, however much of the threat also comes from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it might be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
