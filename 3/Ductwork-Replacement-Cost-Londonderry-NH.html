<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective.
