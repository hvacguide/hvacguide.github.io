<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short biking in very winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact one of our service technicians if you require clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
