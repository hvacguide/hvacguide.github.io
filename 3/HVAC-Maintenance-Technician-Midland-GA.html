<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, intend on spending several thousand dollars for the total system.
