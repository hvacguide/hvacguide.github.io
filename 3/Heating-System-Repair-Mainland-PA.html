<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
