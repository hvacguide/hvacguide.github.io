However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
