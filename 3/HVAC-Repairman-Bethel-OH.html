<p>Biological contaminants: the biological pollutants can include germs, viruses, fungi (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach allergen, and so on. and may result from inadequate maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by residents, seepage, or ventilation air. Allergic actions to indoor biological pollutant direct exposures cause symptoms in allergic people and likewise play an essential role in triggering asthma episodes for an estimated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
