<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
