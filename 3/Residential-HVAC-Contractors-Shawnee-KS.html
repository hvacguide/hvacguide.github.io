<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
