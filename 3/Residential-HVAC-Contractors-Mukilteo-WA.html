<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
