<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
