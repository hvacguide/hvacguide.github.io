<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.
