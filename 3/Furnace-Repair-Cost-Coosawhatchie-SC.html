<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
