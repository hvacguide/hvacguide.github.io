<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
