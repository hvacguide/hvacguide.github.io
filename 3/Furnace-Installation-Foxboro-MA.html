<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
