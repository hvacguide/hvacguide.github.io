<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
