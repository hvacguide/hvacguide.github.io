For this reason, it is necessary to focus on the time and location the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>

However, pick your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
