<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.
