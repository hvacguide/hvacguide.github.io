<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
