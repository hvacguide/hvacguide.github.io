<p>Many people undervalue the level of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the house.

<p>Because these activities create big quantities of lead dust, people have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or housing department for suggestions on which personal labs or public firms may have the ability to help check your house for lead in paint. House test packages can not identify percentages of lead under some conditions. Employ an individual with special training for fixing lead paint problems to get rid of lead-based paint. Residents, especially children and pregnant ladies, need to leave the building up until all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>

Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
