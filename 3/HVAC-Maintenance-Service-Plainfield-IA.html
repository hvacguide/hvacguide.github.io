<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Plainfield IA?</h3>
<p>By continuously developing new ideas, Hutchinson can show you how to save money on your air heating, cooling, and conditioning costs. As premiere heating and AC contractors, we can assess if your existing air conditioning system or heater fits your requirements or if a much better service exists. We can likewise offer tune-ups for your air conditioning unit or heating system to improve performance and extend its beneficial life.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
