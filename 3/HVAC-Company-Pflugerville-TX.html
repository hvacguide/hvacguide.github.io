<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs.

Similar to determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything requires to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient.

<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
