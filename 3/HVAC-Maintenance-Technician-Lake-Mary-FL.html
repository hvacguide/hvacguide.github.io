<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples analyzed were evaluated positive for bacteria and fungis.<p>
