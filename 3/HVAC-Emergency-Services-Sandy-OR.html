<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
