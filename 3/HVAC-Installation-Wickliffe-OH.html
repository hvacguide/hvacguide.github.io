<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
