<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
