<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
