It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
