<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health problems.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.)

The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
