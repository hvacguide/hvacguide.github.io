If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly.
