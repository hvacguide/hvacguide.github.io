<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot.

<p>Heating systems are devices whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the structure. This can be done via central heating Such a system includes a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central place such as a furnace space in a home, or a mechanical space in a large building. The heat can be transferred by radiation, conduction, or convection Area heaters are utilized to heat single spaces and only include a single unit.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
