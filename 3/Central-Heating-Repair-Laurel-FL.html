<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

The best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the same quantity of cooling.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
