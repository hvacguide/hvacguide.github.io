<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, cruel summertime.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
