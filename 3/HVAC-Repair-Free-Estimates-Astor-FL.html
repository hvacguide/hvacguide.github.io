<h3>Electric Heating System in Astor FL</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
