Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from.
