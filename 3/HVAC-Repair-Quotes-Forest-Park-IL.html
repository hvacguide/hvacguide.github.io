<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Forest Park IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
