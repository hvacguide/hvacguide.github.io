<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new.
