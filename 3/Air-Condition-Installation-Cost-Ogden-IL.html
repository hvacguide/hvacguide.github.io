<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
