<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
