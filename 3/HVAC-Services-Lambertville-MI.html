<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
