One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then produces heat.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water.

Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
