<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
