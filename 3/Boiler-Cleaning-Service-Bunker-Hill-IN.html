<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Bunker Hill IN</h3>

They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
