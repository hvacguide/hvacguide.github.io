<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Lincoln MO</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
