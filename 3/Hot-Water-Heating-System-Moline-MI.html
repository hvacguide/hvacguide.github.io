<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area.
