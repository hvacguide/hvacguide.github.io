<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
