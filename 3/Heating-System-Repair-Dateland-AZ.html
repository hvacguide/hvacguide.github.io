<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
