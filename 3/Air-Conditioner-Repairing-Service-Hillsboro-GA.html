<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more efficient design can combat volatile energy rates, lowering your heating expenses by approximately 45%. Advancements in heating technology have actually led to systems that contaminate less, boost convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace generally has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable effectiveness enabled by law for brand-new gas designs is 78%, and there are various options that accomplish 98%, for near total performance.<p>
