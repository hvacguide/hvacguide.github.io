<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
