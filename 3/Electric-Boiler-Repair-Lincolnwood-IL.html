<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
