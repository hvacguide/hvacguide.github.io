<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To discover smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
