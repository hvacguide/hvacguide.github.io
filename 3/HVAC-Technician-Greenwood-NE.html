<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
