They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
