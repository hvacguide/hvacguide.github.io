<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Palos Verdes Peninsula CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
