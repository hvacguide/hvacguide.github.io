<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
