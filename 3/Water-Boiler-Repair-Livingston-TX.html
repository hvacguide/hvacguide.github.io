<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, limiting air flow.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
