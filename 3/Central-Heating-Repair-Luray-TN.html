<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
