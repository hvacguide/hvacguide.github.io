<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
