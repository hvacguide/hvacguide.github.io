<p>We take a look at hints before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
