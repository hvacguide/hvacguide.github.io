All of the current heating systems are much more energy-efficient than those set up even 20 years earlier.

<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health effects discussed. However, it is not necessarily true that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the house.

<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home may not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become musty.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
