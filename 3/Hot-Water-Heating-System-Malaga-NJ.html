<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Malaga NJ?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
