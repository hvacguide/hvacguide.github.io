During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
