<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Florham Park</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
