<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Orange Lake FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
