<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
