<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home.

<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building."

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
