<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To detect odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
