<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
