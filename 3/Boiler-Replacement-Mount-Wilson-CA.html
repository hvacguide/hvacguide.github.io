The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
