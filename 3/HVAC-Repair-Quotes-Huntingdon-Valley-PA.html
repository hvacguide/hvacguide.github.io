<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Huntingdon Valley PA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
