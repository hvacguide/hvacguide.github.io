<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a method that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
