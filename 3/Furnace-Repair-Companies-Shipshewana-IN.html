<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
