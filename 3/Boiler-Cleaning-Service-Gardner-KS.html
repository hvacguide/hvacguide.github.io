<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage.

Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
