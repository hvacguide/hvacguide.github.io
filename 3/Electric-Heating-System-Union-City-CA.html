<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities.

Signs that can show your home may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty.
