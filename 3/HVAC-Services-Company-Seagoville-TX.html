<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
