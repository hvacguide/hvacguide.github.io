<p>Although installation is simple and doesn't require much time, attempting this task is not a great idea.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
