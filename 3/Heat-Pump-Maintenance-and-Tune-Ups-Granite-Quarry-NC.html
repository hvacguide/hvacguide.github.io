When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house.

Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
