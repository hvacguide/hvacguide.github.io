<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Athens Texas</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer reliable and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
