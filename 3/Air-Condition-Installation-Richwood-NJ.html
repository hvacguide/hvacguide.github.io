<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
