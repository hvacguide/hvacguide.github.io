<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is trusted and really cared about us and our scenario. We came home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Rialto CA</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
