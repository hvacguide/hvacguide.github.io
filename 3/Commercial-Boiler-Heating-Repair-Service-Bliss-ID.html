Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line?

Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
