For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
