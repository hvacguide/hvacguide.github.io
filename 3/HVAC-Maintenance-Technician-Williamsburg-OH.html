<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Williamsburg OH Home Owners</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "general responsibility clause" uses. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that a company must offer a safe and healthy  office. Therefore, making sure the air is of good quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
