<p>5. Smell great naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney fragrance with a clean kitchen area or tidy synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners discharge dozens of various chemicals into the air.

Such details can often be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
