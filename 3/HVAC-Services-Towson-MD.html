<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
