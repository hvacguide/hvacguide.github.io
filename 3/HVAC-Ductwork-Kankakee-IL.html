<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
