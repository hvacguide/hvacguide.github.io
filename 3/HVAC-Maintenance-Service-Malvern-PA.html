<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
