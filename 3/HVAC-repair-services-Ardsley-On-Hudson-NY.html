Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
