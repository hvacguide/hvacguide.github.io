<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
