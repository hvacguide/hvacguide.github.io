<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
