<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
