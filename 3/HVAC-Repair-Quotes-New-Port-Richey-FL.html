<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
