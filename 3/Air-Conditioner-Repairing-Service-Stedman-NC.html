<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
