<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
