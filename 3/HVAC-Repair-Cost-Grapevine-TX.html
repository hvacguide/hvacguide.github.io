<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
