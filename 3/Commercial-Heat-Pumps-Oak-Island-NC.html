<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.
