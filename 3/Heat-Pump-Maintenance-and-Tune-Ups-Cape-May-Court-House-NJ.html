<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly unusual now.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece next to your house's foundation. This kind of a/c likewise is used in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the home's exterior wall or roof to connect with the packaged ac system, which is typically located outdoors. Packaged ac system frequently include electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heating unit removes the requirement for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>A/c unit can produce a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
