<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and keep.<p>
