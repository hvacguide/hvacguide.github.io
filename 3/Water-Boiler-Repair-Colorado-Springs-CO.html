<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
