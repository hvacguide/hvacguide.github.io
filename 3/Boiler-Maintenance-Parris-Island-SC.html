<h3>Air Condition System in Parris Island SC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too small and your ac system won't be able to cool the house appropriately. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system.
