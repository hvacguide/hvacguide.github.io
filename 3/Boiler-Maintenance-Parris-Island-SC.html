<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner?
