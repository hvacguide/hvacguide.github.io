<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the suggested connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators employed combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
