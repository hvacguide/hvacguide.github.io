Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
