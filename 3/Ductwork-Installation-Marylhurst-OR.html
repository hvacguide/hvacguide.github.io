<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at Marylhurst OR?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
