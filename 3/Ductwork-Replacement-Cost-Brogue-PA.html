<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
