<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure differences created by these forces move airborne pollutants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>

Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition spaces, however do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
