<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits allow you to avoid the need for a full duct system like most other cooling systems need.
