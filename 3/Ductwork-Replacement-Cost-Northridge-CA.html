<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
