<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
