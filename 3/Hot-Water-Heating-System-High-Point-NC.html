<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your High Point NC Home</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
