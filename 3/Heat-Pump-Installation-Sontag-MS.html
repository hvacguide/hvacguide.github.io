<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Air conditioner manufacturers usually make rugged, high quality products. Start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.
