<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
