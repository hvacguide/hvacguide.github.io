<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>

The building type included both residential and commercial. The majority of samples evaluated were evaluated positive for fungi and germs.<p>
