In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
