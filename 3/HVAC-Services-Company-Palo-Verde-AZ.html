<p>Today's house convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be set up across the whole sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not toxic, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria might also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
