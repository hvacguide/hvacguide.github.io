Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation organisation totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system aesthetically examined at least. This evaluation is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance.

That's the last thing you desire since you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is fixed. Regular examination and maintenance also helps keep it in great shape and extends its life.<p>
