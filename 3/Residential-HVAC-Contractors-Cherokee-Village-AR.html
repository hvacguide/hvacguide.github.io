<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
