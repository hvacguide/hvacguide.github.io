<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Thornton PA</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went on and bought this Carrier and I should say it does the job rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
