<p>New air conditioners normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score suggests greater energy performance and potentially lower energy expenses. A good SEER ranking for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER score is going to be much more energy effective than your present, old a/c unit. It's not always about picking the design with the greatest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Prior to setting up any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is required to re decrease the energy and examine load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not just lower the cost of a new system and energy expenses, however it will considerably enhance the comfort of your home.
