<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
