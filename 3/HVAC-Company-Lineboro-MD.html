It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
