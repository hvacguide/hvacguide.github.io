By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
