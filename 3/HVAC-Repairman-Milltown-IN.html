<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>We included a brand-new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Integrity we were given a great quote on a glowing flooring system.

It was a satisfaction working with such a professional company and would highly suggest them to anyone looking for HVAC.<p>

Call us today and have confidence in your air conditioning unit all summer season long.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be better to replace the entire system.<p>
