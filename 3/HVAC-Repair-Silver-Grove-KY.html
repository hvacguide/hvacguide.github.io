<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
