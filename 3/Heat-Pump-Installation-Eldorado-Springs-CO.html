To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
