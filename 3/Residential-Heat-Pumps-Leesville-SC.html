To ensure the system you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
