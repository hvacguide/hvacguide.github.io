<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
