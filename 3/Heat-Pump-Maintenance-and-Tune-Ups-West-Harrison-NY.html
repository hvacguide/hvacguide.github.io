<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
