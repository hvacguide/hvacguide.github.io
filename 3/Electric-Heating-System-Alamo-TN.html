<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.

Review of this data might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
