<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
