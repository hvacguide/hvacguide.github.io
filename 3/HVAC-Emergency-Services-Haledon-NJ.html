<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") explains how inside air can impact a person's health, ability, and convenience to work.

Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer guidelines about the most common IAQ office problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be constantly provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
