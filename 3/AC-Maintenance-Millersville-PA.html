<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
