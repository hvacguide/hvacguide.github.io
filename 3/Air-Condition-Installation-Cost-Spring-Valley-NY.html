Check the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it if the air filter is great to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
