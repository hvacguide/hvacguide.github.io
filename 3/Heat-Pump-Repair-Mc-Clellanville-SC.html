<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
