<p>Remember that the SEER rating is calculated using the very same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer season temperature to reach the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83.

<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
