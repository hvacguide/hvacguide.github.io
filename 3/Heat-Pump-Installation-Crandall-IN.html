<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
