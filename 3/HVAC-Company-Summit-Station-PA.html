<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed.

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Summit Station PA</h3>
<p>Seattle furnaces can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, however like your vehicle, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running efficiently, avoid problems, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an exceptional job in making certain we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were expert and fast, while taking time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
