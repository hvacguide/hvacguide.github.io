<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Shartlesville PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
