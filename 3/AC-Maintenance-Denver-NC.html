<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") explains how inside air can affect an individual's health, convenience, and ability to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, absence of outside air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does provide standards about the most typical IAQ workplace problems.<p>
