The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually conducted.

These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system?

Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your ac system will not have the ability to cool your house correctly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account.
