<h3>HVAC Companies in Rollinsville CO</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
