<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
