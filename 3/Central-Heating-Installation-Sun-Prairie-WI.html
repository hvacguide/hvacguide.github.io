Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, terrible summer.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a high-end product and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you dedicate to what can be a major renovation task, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is an appropriate solution for your specific home heating needs.<p>
