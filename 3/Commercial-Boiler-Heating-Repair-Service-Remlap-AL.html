<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, however cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
