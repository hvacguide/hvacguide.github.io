<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
