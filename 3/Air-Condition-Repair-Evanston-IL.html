<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company ought to examine measurements of air, temperature level and humidity circulation. In addition, examination and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for developing usage and tenancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be handy. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungis or germs and require to be eliminated, also. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of building tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
