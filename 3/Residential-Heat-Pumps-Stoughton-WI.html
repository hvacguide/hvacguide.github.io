<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
