<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
