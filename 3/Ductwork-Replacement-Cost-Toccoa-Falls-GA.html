Though particular regulations have not been established for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Health Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>These concepts-- and determination to suffer through the heat-- may currently be changing. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing systems have actually been built in the 4 years since or are currently under building. The huge majority of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where air conditioning is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>During regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, wetness from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal parts. Airborne components from normal family items and surfaces can lead to formicary rust within your HVAC devices.

For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and available source of energy.<p>
