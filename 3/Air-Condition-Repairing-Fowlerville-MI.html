<h3>HVAC Supply in Fowlerville Michigan</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other irritants under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioning unit during summer season) helps in reducing moisture in indoor air and efficiently manages allergens, Lang says. An air conditioning system also decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -victims.<p>
