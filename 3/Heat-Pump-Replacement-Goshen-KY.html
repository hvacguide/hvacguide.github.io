<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Goshen KY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
