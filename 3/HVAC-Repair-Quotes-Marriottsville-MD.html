<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
