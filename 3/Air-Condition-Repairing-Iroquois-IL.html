<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system.
