<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
