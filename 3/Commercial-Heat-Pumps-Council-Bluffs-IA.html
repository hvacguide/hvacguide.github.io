<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made items.

<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
