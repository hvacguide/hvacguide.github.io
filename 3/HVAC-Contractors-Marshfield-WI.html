<p>You may decide to keep your service and product line simple for now if you're in the first few years of organisation.

<p>Radiant heat includes installing coils or pipes in the flooring, supplying heat from below and moving upward. It presents an even, general heat temperature throughout the room. Without any moving parts, it's really peaceful and comfortable, and it doesn't stir up as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
