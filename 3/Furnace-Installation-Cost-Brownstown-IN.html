<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
