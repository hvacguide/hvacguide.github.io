<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
