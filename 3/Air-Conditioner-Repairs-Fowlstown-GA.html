<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps ought to not be undertaken till these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system might become really dirty. These aspects of the equipment are vital for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all parts, and examines connections to guarantee they are protected. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for appropriate function and general condition. This is an excellent opportunity to identify parts that are worn or malfunctioning. When the issue is relatively minor, replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less costly.<p>
