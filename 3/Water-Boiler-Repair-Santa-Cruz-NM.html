<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.
