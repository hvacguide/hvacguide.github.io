<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
