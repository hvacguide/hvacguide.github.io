<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
