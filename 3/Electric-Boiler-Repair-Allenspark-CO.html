The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being an important issue to homeowners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have identified numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors.
