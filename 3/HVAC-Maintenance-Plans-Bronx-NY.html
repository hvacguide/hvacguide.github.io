<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
