<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
