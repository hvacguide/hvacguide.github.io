<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
