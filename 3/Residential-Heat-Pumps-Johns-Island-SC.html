<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Johns Island SC Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians believed they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
