<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
