These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. As a result, the most effective way to decrease exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
