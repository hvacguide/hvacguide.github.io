<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Napoleonville LA</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "general task clause" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that an employer must supply a healthy and safe office. Thus, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
