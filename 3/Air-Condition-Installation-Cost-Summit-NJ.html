<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
