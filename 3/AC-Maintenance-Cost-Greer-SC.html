<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
