<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.

For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
