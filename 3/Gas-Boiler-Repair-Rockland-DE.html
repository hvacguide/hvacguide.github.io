<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Rockland Delaware</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's a simple problem like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately closed down the heat pump if temperature levels reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can build up and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up till several years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task sites.<p>
