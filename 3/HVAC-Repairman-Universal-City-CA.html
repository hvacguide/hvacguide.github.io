Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a business or seller to do the installation.

A voided warranty won't do you any excellent should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and work with a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
