<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
