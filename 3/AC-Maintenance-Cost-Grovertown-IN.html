Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result.

<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
