<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
