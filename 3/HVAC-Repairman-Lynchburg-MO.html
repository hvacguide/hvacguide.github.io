<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Lynchburg MO HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature-- in many cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." In other words, in-floor heater provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
