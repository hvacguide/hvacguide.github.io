<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
