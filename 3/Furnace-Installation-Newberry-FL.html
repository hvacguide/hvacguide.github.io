The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
