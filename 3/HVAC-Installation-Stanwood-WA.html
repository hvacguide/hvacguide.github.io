<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Stanwood WA?</h3>
<p>Medical facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce infection threat and the humidity controlled to restrict client dehydration. Although temperatures are typically in the convenience range, some expert procedures, such as open heart surgery, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the goal might be to not just control temperature, but likewise humidity, air quality, and air movement from area to space.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
