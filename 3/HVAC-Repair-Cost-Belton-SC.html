<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
