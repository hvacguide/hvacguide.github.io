<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
