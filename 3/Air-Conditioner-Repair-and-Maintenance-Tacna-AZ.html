<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and efficient  method to lower ambient air contamination and prospective health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a risk just when they are dealt with in such a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for substantial health problems.<p>
