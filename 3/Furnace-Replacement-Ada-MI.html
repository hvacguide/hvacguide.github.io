Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
