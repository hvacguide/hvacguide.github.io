<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to evaluate building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches used primarily in building research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators. NIST researchers are continually establishing new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to examine their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has led to the development of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>To help medical facilities dealing with patients with the unique coronavirus (COVID-19), Carrier launched the OptiClean portable negative air maker, which cleans and eliminates air possibly contaminated by the infection.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
