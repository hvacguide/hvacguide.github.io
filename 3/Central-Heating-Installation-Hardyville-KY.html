<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Hardyville KY HVAC Company</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has actually permitted only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specified formaldehyde emission limits in the building and construction of upraised and mobile houses. In the past, some of these houses had elevated levels of formaldehyde because of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood items utilized in their building and since of their reasonably small interior area.<p>
