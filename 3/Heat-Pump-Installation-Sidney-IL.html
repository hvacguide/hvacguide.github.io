Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual events.<p>
