<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
