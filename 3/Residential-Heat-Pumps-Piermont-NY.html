<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
