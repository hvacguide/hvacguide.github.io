<p>Info offered in this safety guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Manufacturers normally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
