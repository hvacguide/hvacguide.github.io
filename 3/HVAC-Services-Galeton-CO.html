<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
