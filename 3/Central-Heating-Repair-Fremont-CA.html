<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
