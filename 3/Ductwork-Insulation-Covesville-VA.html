<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
