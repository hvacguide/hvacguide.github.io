<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Berkeley Heights NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
