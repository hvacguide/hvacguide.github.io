The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
