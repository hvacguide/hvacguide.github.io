<h3>Installation of HVAC in Saint James Louisiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
<p>Most people don't understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break in time. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and eventually damage it enough that you need to buy furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully analyze the connections and examine the efficiency of the system. They'll try to find frayed and harmed wires and replace them in order to lessen the danger of fire and component failure.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
