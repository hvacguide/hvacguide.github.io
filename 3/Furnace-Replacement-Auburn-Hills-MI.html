<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
