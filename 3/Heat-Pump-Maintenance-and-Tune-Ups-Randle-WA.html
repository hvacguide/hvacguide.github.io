<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and supply an amazing customer experience. To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the precise type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outside metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The air conditioning system's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. If your home currently has no air but a furnace conditioner, a split-system is the most economical central air conditioning conditioner to set up.<p>
