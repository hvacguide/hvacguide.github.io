<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system?
