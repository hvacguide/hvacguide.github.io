<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
