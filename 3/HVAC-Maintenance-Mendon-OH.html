<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Mendon Ohio</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
