<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
