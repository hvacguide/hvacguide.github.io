<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can usually be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
