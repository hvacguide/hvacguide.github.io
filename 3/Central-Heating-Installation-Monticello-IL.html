<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power ought to not surpass the capability of the outside unit.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
