<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas heating systems can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
