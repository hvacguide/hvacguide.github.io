<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution.

<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an outstanding task in making certain we comprehended the pros and cons of each option. The technicians who set up the new system were fast and professional, while taking some time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
