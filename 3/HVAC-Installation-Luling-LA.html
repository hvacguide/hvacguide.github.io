<p>New air conditioners normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking indicates higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER score is going to be much more energy effective than your present, old air conditioning unit. It's not constantly about selecting the model with the greatest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which usually is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside your house's structure.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Both should be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
