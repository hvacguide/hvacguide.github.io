<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
