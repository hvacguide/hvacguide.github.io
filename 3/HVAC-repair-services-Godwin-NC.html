<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
