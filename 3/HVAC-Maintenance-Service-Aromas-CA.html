<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
