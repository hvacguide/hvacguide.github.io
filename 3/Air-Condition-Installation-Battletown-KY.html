<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior.
