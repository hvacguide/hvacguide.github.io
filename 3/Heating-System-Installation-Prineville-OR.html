<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
