<p>There are many things to take into account when trying to find out how typically I must change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them.

<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.
