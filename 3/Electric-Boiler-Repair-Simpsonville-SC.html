<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
