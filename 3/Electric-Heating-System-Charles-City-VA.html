<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c.

<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment.
