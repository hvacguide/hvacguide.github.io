The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.
