It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits.

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in really winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the very low temperatures.
