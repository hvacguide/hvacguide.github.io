<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Company in Draper Utah</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
