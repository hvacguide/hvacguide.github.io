<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Biscoe North Carolina</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
