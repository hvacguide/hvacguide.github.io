<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Norfolk</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
