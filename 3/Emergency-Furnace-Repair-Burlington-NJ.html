<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

York AC units are likewise known for being very quiet and are a great alternative when sound is a genuine concern.<p>
