Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
