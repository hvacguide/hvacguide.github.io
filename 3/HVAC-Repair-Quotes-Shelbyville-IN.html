<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
