<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
