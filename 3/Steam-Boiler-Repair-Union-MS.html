Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
