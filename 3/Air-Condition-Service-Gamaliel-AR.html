<p>Professional heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
