<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor.
