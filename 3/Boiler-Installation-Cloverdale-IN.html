<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered excellent customer care at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
