Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, update the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
