We have the experience and resources needed to assist from the planning phases through to the final installation.

<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, first make certain the air filter is clean and in excellent condition. Next, examine other parts of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, particles and dust, an inexpensive repair that can help improve efficiency. Also, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Attempt moving it far from direct sunlight given that this might affect temperature readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature in your house. If this takes place, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your home feeling cold. You might also need to inspect your insulation to ensure that warm air does not leave from your area through different openings.<p>
