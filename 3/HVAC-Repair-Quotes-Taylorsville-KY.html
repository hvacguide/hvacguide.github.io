Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
