This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
