<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioner, several main factors require to be considered. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there must not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outside unit needs to also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply. It is extremely advisable to set up the a/c unit units in easily accessible locations, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
