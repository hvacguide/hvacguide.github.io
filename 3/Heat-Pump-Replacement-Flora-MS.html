<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
