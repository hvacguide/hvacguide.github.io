<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at West New York NJ</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
