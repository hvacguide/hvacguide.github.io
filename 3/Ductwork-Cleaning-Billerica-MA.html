The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
