<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
