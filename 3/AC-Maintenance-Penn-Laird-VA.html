We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
