<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system.

Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
