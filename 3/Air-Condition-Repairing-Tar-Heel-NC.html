HVAC experts recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main risk of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than many allergenic properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing disease.<p>
