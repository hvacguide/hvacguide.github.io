Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made products.

<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations construct up inside your home.<p>
