<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out straight from the ground, it secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or pollutants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system.

The bright side is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
