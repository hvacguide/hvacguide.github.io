<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
