<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
