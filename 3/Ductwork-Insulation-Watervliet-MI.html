Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
