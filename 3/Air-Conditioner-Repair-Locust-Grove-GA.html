<p>There are a few main points that homeowners will want to take into account when choosing which of the best AC systems they need to set up in their homes. It actually depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The major factors for most property owners will be the overall cost to set up the best a/c unit brand names, lifespan of the AC unit, service warranties offered, energy effectiveness (SEER ratings), and size of the system you require for your house's square video footage (HEAPS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
