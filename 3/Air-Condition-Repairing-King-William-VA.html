<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in King William VA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
