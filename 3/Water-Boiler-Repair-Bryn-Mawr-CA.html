<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided excellent customer support at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
