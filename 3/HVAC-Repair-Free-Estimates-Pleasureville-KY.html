<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
