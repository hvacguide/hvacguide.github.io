He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may want to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
