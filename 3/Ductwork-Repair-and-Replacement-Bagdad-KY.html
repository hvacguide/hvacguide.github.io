<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Bagdad KY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
