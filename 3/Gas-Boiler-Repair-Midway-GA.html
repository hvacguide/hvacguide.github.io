<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become clogged, lowering air flow circulation, quality, and volume. They likewise may end up being places for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be properly maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
