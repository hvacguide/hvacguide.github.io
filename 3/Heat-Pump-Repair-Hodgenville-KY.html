An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
