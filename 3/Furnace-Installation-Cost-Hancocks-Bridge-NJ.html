<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on private sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>For example, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly situated outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score means higher energy performance and potentially lower energy costs.

Use them to dispose of the unwanted containers securely if such days are available. If no such collection days are readily available, think about organizing one.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
