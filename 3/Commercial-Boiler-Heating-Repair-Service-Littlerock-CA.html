<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
