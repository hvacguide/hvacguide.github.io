<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
