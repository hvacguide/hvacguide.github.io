The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Butler MD</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
