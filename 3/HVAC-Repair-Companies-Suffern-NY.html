These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
