<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Heating System Installation in Greenville SC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
