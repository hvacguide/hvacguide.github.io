<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Brookfield IL</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "general duty clause" uses. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that an employer needs to supply a healthy and safe workplace. Hence, ensuring the air is of good quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
