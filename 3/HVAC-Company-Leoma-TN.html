<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
