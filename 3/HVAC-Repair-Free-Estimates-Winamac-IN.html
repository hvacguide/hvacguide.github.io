Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>AC Technician in Winamac Indiana</h3>
