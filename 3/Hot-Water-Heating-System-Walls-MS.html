<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation company completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
