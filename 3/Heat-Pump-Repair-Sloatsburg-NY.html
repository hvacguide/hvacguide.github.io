<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
