<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
