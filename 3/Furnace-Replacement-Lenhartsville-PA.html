<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Lenhartsville PA?</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Provider and I should say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off the house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
