Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>First of all, The after hours responding to service agent, John, was expert and really courteous. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, well-informed technician. He was at my house within the time he provided me, fixed the issue while describing the issue then remained several minutes to make sure it was working correctly.
