<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically build up in ductwork, limiting air flow.

<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outside air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, people with asthma might discover being inside your home uses the best relief, if the indoor air environment is excellent.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
