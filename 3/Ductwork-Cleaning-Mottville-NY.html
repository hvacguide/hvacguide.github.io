<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
