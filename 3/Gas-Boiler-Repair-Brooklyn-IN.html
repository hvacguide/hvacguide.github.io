These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
