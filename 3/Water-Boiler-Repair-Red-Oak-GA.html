I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
