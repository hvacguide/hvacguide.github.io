<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now.

He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
