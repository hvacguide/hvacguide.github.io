<p>Heating units are devices whose purpose is to create heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via central heating Such a system includes a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central area such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical space in a large building.
