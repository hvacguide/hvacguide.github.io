The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
