<p>Devices costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heating system. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however result in higher energy costs.

<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
