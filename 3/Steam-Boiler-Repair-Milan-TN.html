<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled.
