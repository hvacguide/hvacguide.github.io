<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Sidney MI</h3>

Inspect the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with an experienced technician.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
