<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
