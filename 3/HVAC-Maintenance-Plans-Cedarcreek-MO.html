Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years.
