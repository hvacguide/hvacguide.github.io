<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>To establish a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing technicians in your location in an online search.

<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air.
