<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed assessments from the city.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
