<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Part of the structure procedure is setting up heater for brand-new advancements, however existing structures often need to have heating systems set up too. Even the best technology ultimately ends up being eclipsed by newer, more efficient innovation, which can result in a circumstance where it is more cost-effective to set up a brand-new heating system than to repair an existing one.
