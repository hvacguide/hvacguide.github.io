<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
