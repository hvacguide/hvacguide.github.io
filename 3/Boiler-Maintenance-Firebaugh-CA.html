<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for practically 10 years and throughout that time, they have actually always provided excellent service. Everyone I have dealt with is professional and friendly. The techs are timely, effective and considerate.

Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
