<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Moody AL</h3>
<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow may likewise add to employee health complaints. Temperature levels should range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation must be avoided.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.)
