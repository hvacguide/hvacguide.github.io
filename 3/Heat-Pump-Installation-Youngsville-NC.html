<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
