<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Rogersville AL</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be put. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals primarily remain seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
