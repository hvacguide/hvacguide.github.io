<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
