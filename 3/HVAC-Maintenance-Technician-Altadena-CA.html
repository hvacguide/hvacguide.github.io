<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Altadena CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Clogged gutters can lead to water seeping into your house, leading to mold growth, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow practically anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your home. Direct exposure to high levels of home mold may trigger mold allergic reaction symptoms. Next time it rains, examine your gutters. If you see water dripping out of end caps, streaming on the outdoors, or leaking behind them, it's time to get out the ladder.<p>
