<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
