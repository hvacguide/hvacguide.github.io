It takes roughly 5 hours to install a little furnace and more to set up a big one.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
