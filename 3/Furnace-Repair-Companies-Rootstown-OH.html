<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>It is then smart to vet the recommended contractors by doing research and using a service like Modernize to immediately compare numerous quotes from the leading HVAC contractors.
