<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
