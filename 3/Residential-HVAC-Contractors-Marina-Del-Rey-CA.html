<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Climate Pro is reputable and really appreciated us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my friends.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
