<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Pine Lake GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
