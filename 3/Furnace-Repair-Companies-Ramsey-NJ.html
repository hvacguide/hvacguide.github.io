<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Ramsey NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
