Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
