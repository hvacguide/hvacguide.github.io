Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
