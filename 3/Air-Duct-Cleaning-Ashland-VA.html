<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Ashland VA?</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
