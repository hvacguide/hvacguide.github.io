Improper modification, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or variety, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
