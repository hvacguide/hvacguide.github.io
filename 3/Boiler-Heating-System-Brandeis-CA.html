Working on electrical power, a heatpump is a cost-effective service using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>

<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water since they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
