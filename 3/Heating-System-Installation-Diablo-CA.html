<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating & cooling system uses considerably less electrical power compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and readily available source of energy.<p>

By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices.
