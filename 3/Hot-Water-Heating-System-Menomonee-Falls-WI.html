<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
