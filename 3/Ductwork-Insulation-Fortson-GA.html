<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c will not have the ability to cool the house effectively. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Your furnace is an investment; if dealt with right, it could heat your home for several years without problems. If left ignored, a furnace is prone to breakdowns, performance problems, and devastating failures, which could lead to severe emergency situations. Our local furnace maintenance specialists are prepared to supply your furnace with the attention it needs to last for several years to come. We provide a range of maintenance strategies to fit all spending plans and needs.<p>
