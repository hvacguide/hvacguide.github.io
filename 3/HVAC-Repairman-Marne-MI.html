<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
