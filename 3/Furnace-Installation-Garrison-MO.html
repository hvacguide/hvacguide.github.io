<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
