<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can likewise result from lead dust from outside sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
