The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
