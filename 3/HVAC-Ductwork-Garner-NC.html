<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
