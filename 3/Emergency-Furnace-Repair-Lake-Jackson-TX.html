When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
