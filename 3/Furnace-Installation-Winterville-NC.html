<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
