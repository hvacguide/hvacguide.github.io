If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
