<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise technology. Martin stated the company can establish a dashboard within the building's controls that will provide information on its systems to enable actual time visibility, providing the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not just throughout new building.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
