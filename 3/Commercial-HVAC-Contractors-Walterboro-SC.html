<p>A health survey must be developed and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool should determine the number of people impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health symptoms or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the workplace; show the kind of outdoors air contamination; and determine possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more typical as available services in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as consumers remain mostly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
