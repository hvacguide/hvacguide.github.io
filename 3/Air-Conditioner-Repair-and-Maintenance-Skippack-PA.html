Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
