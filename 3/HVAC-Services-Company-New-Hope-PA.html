Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
