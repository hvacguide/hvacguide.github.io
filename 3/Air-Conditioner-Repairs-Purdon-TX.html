<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
