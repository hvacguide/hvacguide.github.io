Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items.
