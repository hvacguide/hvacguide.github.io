<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
