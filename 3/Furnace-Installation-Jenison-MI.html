<p>We look at clues before we offer suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
