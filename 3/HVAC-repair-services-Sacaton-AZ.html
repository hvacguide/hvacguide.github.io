<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>House owners may also presume that since a radiant floor heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their home's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Possibly Real estate agents must consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any offered asking price. That stated, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
