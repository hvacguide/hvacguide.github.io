He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality.
