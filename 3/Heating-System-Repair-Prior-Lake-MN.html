<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
