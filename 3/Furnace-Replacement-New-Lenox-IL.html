This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
