<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
