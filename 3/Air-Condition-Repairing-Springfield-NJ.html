<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin resulting from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
