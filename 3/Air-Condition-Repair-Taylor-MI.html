<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
