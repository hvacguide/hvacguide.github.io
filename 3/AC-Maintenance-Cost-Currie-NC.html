<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than lots of heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you acquire.

And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
