<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Southport NC Home</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
