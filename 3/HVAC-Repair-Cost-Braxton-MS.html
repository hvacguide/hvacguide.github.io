<p>There are many actions a homeowner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are mentioned here.

Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
