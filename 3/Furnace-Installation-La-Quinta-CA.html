<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
