For instance, we may see a window as changing slightly gradually as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
