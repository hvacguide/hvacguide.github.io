<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me.
