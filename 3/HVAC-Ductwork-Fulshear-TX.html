<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
