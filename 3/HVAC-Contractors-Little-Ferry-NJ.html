<p>Information provided in this security guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction leads to changes in each.

In reality, the dirt" we see might be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your air ducts checked by an expert heating and cooling contractor.
