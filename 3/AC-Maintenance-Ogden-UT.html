The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
