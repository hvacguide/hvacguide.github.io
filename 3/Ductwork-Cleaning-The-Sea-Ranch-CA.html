<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
