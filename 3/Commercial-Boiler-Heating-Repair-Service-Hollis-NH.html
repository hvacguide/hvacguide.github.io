Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge houses.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
