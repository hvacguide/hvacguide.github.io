Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
