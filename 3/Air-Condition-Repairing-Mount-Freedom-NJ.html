<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
