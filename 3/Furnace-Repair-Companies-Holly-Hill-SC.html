<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>This was without a doubt the very best and most satisfying service me and my wife have ever gotten. Most importantly the technicians shown up here exactly when they said that they would.

They likewise helped us set up a certain service strategy that in the long run will help us save cash.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
