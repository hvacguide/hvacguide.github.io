<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
