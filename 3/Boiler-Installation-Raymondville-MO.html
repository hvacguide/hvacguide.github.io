<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Raymondville MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
