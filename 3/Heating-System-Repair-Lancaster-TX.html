The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
